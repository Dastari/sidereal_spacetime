**Status:** Active Prompt  
**Date:** 2026-03-15  
**Update 2026-04-23:** Require installed Bevy/Rust skill context, deeper selected-vs-controlled entity auditing, and explicit Lightyear upstream/upgrade-readiness verification for dynamic prediction/interpolation handoff.  
**Scope Note:** Audit the actual current client/server network architecture in this repository, not an idealized design.

Perform a full end-to-end network architecture audit for this repository as a senior Bevy 0.18 / Avian2D / Lightyear / server-authoritative MMO networking engineer.

This is not a generic netcode review. Inspect this specific codebase, its current transport/protocol/runtime behavior, and its current documentation contracts. The deliverable is a formal written report saved under `docs/reports/`.

## Non-Negotiable Audit Stance

Start from a fresh, unbiased view of the codebase.

Do **not** trust prior plans, audits, implementation notes, or migration documents as truth. They may be used as leads or references only.

Only the following should be treated as authoritative project-intent contracts unless the code has clearly superseded them in the same area:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/architecture/sidereal_design_document.md`
- `docs/decision_register.md`
- `docs/features/active/visibility_replication_contract.md`
- `docs/features/active/tactical_and_owner_lane_protocol_contract.md`
- `docs/features/active/asset_delivery_contract.md`
- `docs/decisions/dr-0002_explicit_world_entry_flow.md`
- `docs/decisions/dr-0013_action_acceptor_control_routing.md`
- `docs/decisions/dr-0017_dual_lane_replication_and_owner_asset_manifest.md`
- `docs/decisions/dr-0018_fog_of_war_and_intel_memory_model.md`
- `docs/features/reference/lightyear_upstream_issue_snapshot_reference.md`

All other plans, prompts, investigation docs, and implementation trackers are reference-only. Verify everything against current code before repeating it.

## Repository Context You Must Account For

- This is Sidereal, a server-authoritative multiplayer space MMO/ARPG rebuild.
- The workspace currently pins:
  - `bevy = 0.18.0`
  - a forked Lightyear dependency at `https://github.com/Dastari/lightyear`, rev `29867036`
- The current workspace enables Lightyear prediction, interpolation, frame interpolation, Avian2D integration, native UDP transport, and browser WebTransport support depending on target/runtime.
- The project allows dynamic control swap between owned entities.
- Free-roam is represented by controlling the player entity itself, not by null control.
- The player entity may move and act as the camera/control anchor, but it must **not** implicitly grant visibility just because it is the controlled entity. Only valid visibility/sensor-capable entities may expand visibility.
- The current project has a known Lightyear-related predicted/interpolated control-handoff edge and is temporarily carrying a forked dependency to support the required behavior. You must verify the exact local behavior and distinguish:
  - intentional local workaround,
  - upstream Lightyear limitation/bug,
  - local misuse or architectural drift.
- The current biggest failure area is dynamic selected/controlled entity transitions, especially where Lightyear prediction/interpolation lifecycle limits interact with Sidereal's server-authoritative control model. Treat this as a primary audit thread, not a secondary implementation detail.

## Read First

Before auditing code, read these documents carefully:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/architecture/sidereal_design_document.md`
3. `docs/features/active/visibility_replication_contract.md`
4. `docs/features/active/tactical_and_owner_lane_protocol_contract.md`
5. `docs/features/active/asset_delivery_contract.md`
6. `docs/decision_register.md`
7. `docs/decisions/dr-0002_explicit_world_entry_flow.md`
8. `docs/decisions/dr-0013_action_acceptor_control_routing.md`
9. `docs/decisions/dr-0017_dual_lane_replication_and_owner_asset_manifest.md`
10. `docs/decisions/dr-0018_fog_of_war_and_intel_memory_model.md`
11. `docs/features/reference/lightyear_upstream_issue_snapshot_reference.md`

Then inspect the actual code paths under at least:

- `bins/sidereal-client/`
- `bins/sidereal-replication/`
- `bins/sidereal-gateway/`
- `crates/sidereal-net/`
- `crates/sidereal-game/`
- `crates/sidereal-asset-runtime/`

## Required Skill Context

Before auditing code, load and apply the installed `bevy-game-engine` skill (`/root/sidereal/.agents/skills/bevy-game-engine/SKILL.md`) as an audit lens for Bevy ECS app structure, plugin boundaries, schedules, system ordering, resources/events, runtime frame-loop behavior, and client/server Bevy integration.

Also load and apply the installed `rust-skills` skill (`/rust-skills`, backed by `/root/sidereal/.agents/skills/rust-skills/SKILL.md`) for Rust-specific review of ownership/borrowing, async/blocking behavior, memory/allocation pressure, API design, error handling, testing, linting, and anti-patterns. When a finding comes primarily from this guidance, name the relevant category or rule prefix where useful, such as `async-*`, `err-*`, `mem-*`, `perf-*`, `api-*`, `test-*`, or `anti-*`.

If an additional installed skill exists for Lightyear, Bevy networking/ECS scheduling, Avian2D networking, multiplayer prediction, or game networking, load it as supporting context. Treat skills as audit lenses for concrete repository findings, not as permission to give generic advice.

Do not let generic Bevy, Rust, or networking guidance override Sidereal-specific authority flow, Lightyear integration constraints, Avian2D motion ownership requirements, visibility/redaction contracts, asset delivery contracts, WASM compatibility rules, or contributor rules in `AGENTS.md`.

## Required Upstream Verification

Before forming conclusions about Lightyear limitations or planned fixes, verify upstream state at audit time using primary sources:

- official Lightyear docs/book/API docs,
- the upstream `cBournhonesque/lightyear` release list and tags,
- directly relevant upstream issues, PRs, commits on `main`, and CI/check status for those commits,
- Sidereal's currently pinned fork/revision in `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`.

Distinguish "PR open", "PR merged to upstream `main`", "merged commit has clean CI", "merged commit has failing or inconclusive CI", "commit included in a tagged release", and "Sidereal is actually pinned to that release/commit". Do not assume a future Lightyear release has landed until the release/tag/docs prove it. If a relevant PR has landed on `main` but is not yet released, document it as upstream-main-only and explain what local behavior still must be validated after the release or pin change. If public CI metadata shows failures but logs are unavailable, record the failing job/step names and avoid inferring the root cause.

## Primary Audit Goals

Determine whether the current client/server network architecture is:

1. correct,
2. internally consistent,
3. aligned with the repository’s current contracts,
4. aligned with current Lightyear best practices and documentation,
5. making strong use of current Lightyear and Bevy 0.18 networking/runtime capabilities where appropriate,
6. suitable for a modern top-down space MMO/ARPG,
7. safe, scalable, and maintainable under the project’s control-swap and multi-lane visibility requirements.

## Mandatory Audit Scope

Audit all of the following. Do not skip any category.

### 1. Full network topology

Map the real end-to-end topology, including:

- gateway HTTP/auth/bootstrap routes,
- replication transport endpoints,
- native client transport path,
- WASM/browser transport path,
- WebTransport-first browser path and any fallback behavior,
- asset-delivery HTTP paths,
- internal control/admin paths that affect network authority,
- any debug/inspection network surfaces that matter to security or topology.

Explain what talks to what, over which protocol, with what trust boundary.

### 2. Complete channel and message inventory

Produce a complete matrix of all runtime channels and network-bearing paths, including:

- Lightyear channels,
- message types on each channel,
- reliability/ordering mode,
- priority,
- producer and consumer,
- intended purpose,
- whether current usage matches the documented contract.

At minimum verify the current usage of:

- `ControlChannel`
- `InputChannel`
- `TacticalSnapshotChannel`
- `TacticalDeltaChannel`
- `ManifestChannel`

Also inventory network paths that are **not** Lightyear channels, such as HTTP bootstrap/auth/asset flows.

### 3. World-entry, bootstrap, and initial-state delivery

Audit the complete world-entry sequence:

- auth,
- character selection,
- `/world/enter` or equivalent bootstrap request,
- replication bind/auth,
- `ServerSessionReady`,
- player-entity replication arrival,
- asset-loading gate,
- final transition to `InWorld`.

Pay special attention to:

- whether the selected player entity is guaranteed to replicate before usable world entry,
- whether the persisted last authoritative control target is preserved during bootstrap,
- whether the client speculatively reverts to self-control too early,
- whether the “last known controlled ship” is available to control before or as world entry completes,
- whether initial state delivery is ordered robustly enough for prediction/interpolation/control HUD correctness,
- whether spawned/interpolated entities avoid origin flashes or missing-history gaps during first relevance.

### 4. Player input, entity actions, and authority routing

Audit:

- authenticated input routing,
- session binding to `player_entity_id`,
- controlled-entity validation,
- action routing to `ControlledEntityGuid`,
- free-roam/self-control behavior,
- stale-input expiry,
- heartbeat/change-driven input behavior,
- rejection of mismatched claimed player/entity IDs,
- whether any path allows client-side authority leakage.

Be explicit about how Lightyear native input is used versus Sidereal’s authenticated realtime input lane.

### 5. Dynamic control swap and predicted/interpolated handoff

This is a mandatory deep-focus section.

Audit the complete selected/control/prediction handoff flow when switching between:

- player-anchor self-control,
- owned ship A,
- owned ship B,
- back to player-anchor self-control.

Determine whether the current architecture correctly handles:

- distinction between "selected entity" and "controlled entity",
- persisted player ECS state for selected/control/focus/camera targets,
- client-owned pending local input intent for the currently controlled predicted entity,
- server-owned authoritative control assignment,
- ownership validation,
- authoritative ack/reject flow,
- stale request rejection and out-of-order ack/reject behavior,
- previous controlled-entity neutralization,
- new controlled-entity activation,
- player-anchor following behavior,
- player-anchor free-roam behavior,
- predicted marker transfer,
- interpolated marker transfer,
- confirmed marker and confirmed-state continuity,
- confirmed-history availability,
- interpolation-history bootstrap,
- prediction-history initialization or invalidation,
- frame interpolation continuity,
- rollback/prediction-history continuity,
- local-view/UI/control-state continuity.

Specifically check whether the current Lightyear forked behavior and local code are sufficient for the project’s dynamic predicted/interpolated switching requirements, or whether the architecture still has correctness, visual, or maintainability gaps.

Produce a control-transition matrix covering at least:

- self-control -> ship A,
- ship A -> ship B,
- ship A -> self-control,
- ship A -> disconnected/lost-visibility/nonexistent entity,
- selected-only target change with no control change,
- rejected control request,
- repeated rapid control swaps across multiple ticks.

For each transition, identify the expected server state, client local intent state, replicated control state, predicted/interpolated/confirmed entity roles, input routing behavior, camera/HUD binding, visibility source, and rollback/interpolation-history state.

Explicitly audit whether Sidereal has a single authoritative place deriving Lightyear-facing role state (`ControlledBy`, `Replicate`, `PredictionTarget`, `InterpolationTarget`, visibility rearm/spawn flags, and related per-sender state) from the authenticated player->controlled-entity mapping, or whether multiple systems can race or partially repair each other.

Audit whether changing `PredictionTarget` / `InterpolationTarget` on an already-visible entity is enough in the current Lightyear version/fork, or whether Sidereal still needs an explicit visibility rearm/despawn-respawn/full-spawn path for affected clients. If a rearm path exists, verify it is minimal, deterministic, ordered correctly, and cannot leak unauthorized state.

Audit whether control handoff preserves logical-entity identity across Lightyear clone roles without relying on raw Bevy `Entity` IDs across service/client boundaries. Verify all UI/control/HUD/debug code resolves through stable UUID/entity identity and the correct local clone role.

### 6. Prediction, rollback, reconciliation, interpolation, and frame interpolation

Audit whether the project is making good use of current Lightyear functionality for:

- local prediction,
- rollback,
- reconciliation,
- correction policy,
- remote interpolation,
- frame interpolation,
- Avian2D replication integration,
- required-component availability on predicted/interpolated entities,
- confirmed-history and interpolation-history management.

Verify whether current custom systems are:

- necessary,
- temporary but justified,
- fighting Lightyear,
- duplicating upstream capabilities,
- or leaving modern Lightyear capabilities underused.

Call out where the codebase aligns well with Lightyear and where it diverges.

### 7. Avian2D physics state over the network

Audit whether networked entities receive sufficient authoritative Avian2D state and required components for stable behavior, especially during:

- spawn,
- hydration,
- visibility gain/loss,
- initial world entry,
- control swap,
- predicted/interpolated transitions.

Check in particular whether the effective runtime state includes what is needed for:

- `Position`
- `Rotation`
- `LinearVelocity`
- `AngularVelocity`
- mass/inertia parity where required,
- collision/physics-related required components,
- interpolation history bootstrap for newly relevant entities.

If the current design intentionally does **not** fully attach some physics state on some client clones, determine whether that is correct, risky, or now obsolete.

### 8. Visibility, authorization, delivery culling, and redaction

Read the visibility contract carefully and audit the implementation against it.

You must explicitly analyze the many layers of visibility, including:

- world truth,
- what the client is authorized to know,
- what the client is currently allowed to receive,
- payload redaction after authorization and delivery narrowing,
- owner/public/faction policy,
- scanner/visibility-range capability,
- tactical/fog/intel-memory products,
- discovered-landmark handling if relevant,
- current view-mode and delivery-range signaling,
- range culling for optimization.

You must verify the required ordering:

1. `Authorization`
2. `Delivery`
3. `Payload`

Be explicit about the distinction between:

- “what the client is allowed to see at all”
- “what the client currently can see right now”

Also verify that:

- spatial preselection is optimization-only and not treated as authorization,
- the player entity/free-roam anchor does not accidentally grant visibility unless it truly has valid visibility capability,
- only legitimate sensor/visibility sources extend visibility,
- tactical/fog/owner lanes do not bypass authorization,
- delivery culling is camera/view-mode driven only as a narrowing step.

### 9. Tactical map, fog-of-war, owner-manifest, and other auxiliary lanes

Audit the separate non-world-entity lanes and caches, including:

- tactical fog snapshot/delta flow,
- tactical contact snapshot/delta flow,
- owner asset manifest snapshot/delta flow,
- any local tactical smoothing or cache logic,
- any map-mode delivery-range expansion logic,
- resnapshot behavior and sequence safety.

Determine whether these lanes are:

- correctly separated from local-bubble replication,
- correctly authorized,
- robust under packet loss/order mismatch,
- and appropriate for a large-scale top-down MMO/ARPG.

### 10. Asset delivery as part of the network architecture

Audit asset delivery as a first-class part of the network stack.

Cover:

- startup asset manifest flow,
- startup asset payload flow,
- bootstrap-required asset flow,
- runtime lazy asset fetch flow,
- dependency expansion,
- cache validation/checksum/version behavior,
- asset-catalog version notification,
- separation between replication transport and HTTP asset payload delivery,
- native/WASM parity expectations.

Verify that replication never becomes the asset-payload transport lane and that world entry ordering around assets is correct.

### 11. Modern best-practice comparison

Compare the current implementation to current primary-source Lightyear and Bevy 0.18 references.

Use current primary sources at audit time, not blogspam or secondary summaries. Prefer:

- official Bevy 0.18 docs/release notes,
- official Lightyear docs/book/API docs,
- Lightyear GitHub repo/issues/PRs when directly relevant.

Record the exact upstream version/docs state you used.

You must distinguish:

- upstream-supported best practice,
- upstream-known limitation/bug,
- local intentional deviation,
- local accidental divergence.

Because Lightyear is moving quickly and Sidereal currently carries a fork, this section must also include a Lightyear upgrade-readiness subsection:

- record the exact current workspace Lightyear source/rev and feature set,
- check the current upstream Lightyear release, docs, open issues, and relevant PRs at audit time,
- verify whether Sidereal's forked commits or local PRs have landed upstream, are still open, are merged to upstream `main` but unreleased, or have been superseded,
- verify upstream CI/check status for any Lightyear commit being considered for adoption, including whether failures are formatting-only, test failures, unrelated/flaky, or unknown due to inaccessible logs,
- identify which local workarounds can be deleted after upgrade and which are still required by Sidereal-specific architecture,
- identify expected migration risks for control swap, prediction, interpolation, frame interpolation, Avian2D integration, visibility, transport, and required-component hydration,
- propose a minimal upgrade validation matrix before replacing the fork.

At minimum, re-check the status and implications of:

- upstream `PredictionSwitching` or equivalent support,
- confirmed-history initialization when `Interpolated` is added to an entity that already has confirmed state,
- required-component insertion for interpolated entities,
- per-client prediction/interpolation target changes on already-visible entities,
- input ownership/controlled-entity assignment security,
- Avian2D interpolation/collider/hierarchy integration.

### 12. Scale, performance, and maintainability

Audit whether the current architecture is likely to hold up for:

- many entities,
- multiple owned ships per player,
- frequent control swaps,
- multiple active visibility sources,
- tactical map use,
- fog/intel memory,
- asset streaming,
- native and WASM transport parity.

Call out:

- bandwidth risks,
- ordering risks,
- replay/resnapshot risks,
- authority-boundary risks,
- excessive complexity,
- duplicate systems fighting each other,
- places where the architecture is already strong and should be preserved.

## Required Special Checks

You must explicitly answer all of these:

1. Is the current initial world-state delivery sequence correct for a player who has a persisted non-self controlled ship?
2. Does the current implementation preserve the last authoritative controlled ship cleanly through world entry, prediction adoption, and HUD/control readiness?
3. Does the current implementation correctly separate player-anchor control/camera semantics from visibility/sensor semantics?
4. Are all network channels and side paths clearly justified, correctly configured, and currently used as intended?
5. Is the current tactical/fog/owner multi-lane model architecturally sound?
6. Is the current Lightyear fork usage justified, minimal, and clearly separated from project-local mistakes?
7. Is the project making strong enough use of current Lightyear interpolation/prediction/frame-interpolation capabilities, or is it carrying avoidable custom networking complexity?
8. Are predicted/interpolated Avian2D entities receiving the right physics state and history bootstrap for stable runtime behavior?
9. Does the current visibility implementation actually match the documented multi-tier authorization/delivery/redaction model?
10. Is selected-target state cleanly separated from controlled-target state across persistence, replication, client UI, input routing, and camera behavior?
11. Does rapid A->B->A control switching produce exactly one local input owner and one presentation winner per logical entity, without duplicate-lane repair becoming part of the intended contract?
12. Does the current Lightyear fork/PR path have a clear removal or upgrade plan once upstream includes the needed behavior?
13. If you were hardening this into a modern production-quality top-down space MMO/ARPG networking architecture, what must change first?

## Required Validation Matrix

The report must propose concrete regression coverage for the current failure area, even if the auditor does not implement the tests during the audit. Include recommended unit/integration/live validation for:

- first world entry with persisted self-control,
- first world entry with persisted ship control,
- selected-only target changes,
- self -> ship -> self control cycling,
- ship A -> ship B -> ship A rapid cycling,
- control request rejection and stale ack handling,
- controlled entity losing visibility or despawning,
- late-joining second client observing another client's controlled ship,
- native dedicated client/server validation,
- WASM impact or explicit no-WASM-impact reasoning,
- Lightyear fork vs upstream release comparison after upgrade.

## Output Requirements

Produce a formal audit report with findings ordered by severity:

- `Critical`
- `High`
- `Medium`
- `Low`

For each finding include:

- title,
- severity,
- why it matters,
- exact file/path references,
- whether it is a correctness, security, architecture, performance, maintainability, or documentation issue,
- concrete recommendation,
- whether the recommendation is:
  - must fix,
  - should fix,
  - optional improvement.

Also:

- separate direct evidence from inference,
- call out where code and docs diverge,
- call out where the current design is correct and should be kept,
- do not give generic advice; tie every point to this repository,
- list recommendations in descending criticality order.
