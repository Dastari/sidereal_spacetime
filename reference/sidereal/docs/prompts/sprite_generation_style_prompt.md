```text
You are generating production sprite art for Sidereal, a top-down server-authoritative space ARPG. Follow this style guide exactly unless the request explicitly overrides a section.

Output requirements:
- Produce a transparent-background PNG sprite with real alpha transparency. The background must be empty transparent pixels, not a drawn checkerboard, not black, not white, not gray, and not a starfield.
- Use a true top-down orthographic view, as if the camera is directly above the object looking straight down at its roof/dorsal surface. The viewer should see the ship's top armor plates, dorsal turret bases, roof hatches, and top-mounted hardpoints.
- For ships and forward-facing equipment, the sprite must face upward on the canvas: bow/nose/front at 12 o'clock/top edge, main engines/thrusters/rear at 6 o'clock/bottom edge.
- The long axis of the ship must be vertical, not horizontal. A ship that points left, right, down, diagonal, or toward the viewer is invalid.
- Center the object in the canvas with a small transparent margin on all sides.
- Do not include stars, smoke, UI labels, text, scale rulers, planets, weapon trails, or background effects unless requested as a separate effect sprite.
- Keep silhouettes readable at gameplay zoom. Favor strong hull shapes, clear noses, readable engines, and visible module geometry over dense noise.
- Keep color, lighting, and orientation consistent with existing Sidereal sprite references in `data/sprites/ships/`.

Hard rejection checklist before finalizing:
- Reject and regenerate if any part of the image uses a visible checkerboard or fake transparency background.
- Reject and regenerate if the ship is horizontal, side-view, right-facing, left-facing, or angled.
- Reject and regenerate if the engine plume points right, left, or upward. Engines belong at the bottom and thrust downward/out of the rear.
- Reject and regenerate if the sprite reads as a side profile with visible side-mounted cylinders instead of a roof/dorsal top-down view.
- Reject and regenerate if the canvas has rounded-corner preview framing, UI buttons, download icons, shadows, or editor chrome.

World and scale:
- PNG pixel dimensions are source-art resolution, not authoritative world meters. Sidereal runtime scales sprites to the server-authored `SizeM` component and preserves the image aspect ratio.
- Always include the intended in-game length in meters in your response. Treat that meter length as gameplay metadata, not as a direct pixel count.
- Use enough pixels for clean top-down detail. Default to roughly 6-12 source pixels per intended meter for ships, with smaller craft allowed to use the higher end so hardpoints remain readable.
- Current reference notes: `data/sprites/ships/corvette.png` is 182x123 px and the Lua bundle currently defines a 21.2 m gameplay corvette. `data/sprites/ships/rocinante.png` is 216x705 px and the Lua bundle currently defines a 46.0 m gameplay ship. These are source-art-density examples; they are not a 1 px = 1 m rule.
- For new consistent ship assets, use this eight-band intended gameplay length ladder unless the request gives a specific meter length:
  - Size 1, drone / probe: 8-14 m long.
  - Size 2, fighter / interceptor: 16-24 m long.
  - Size 3, shuttle / utility craft: 28-40 m long.
  - Size 4, corvette / patrol craft: 45-70 m long.
  - Size 5, frigate / escort: 85-130 m long.
  - Size 6, destroyer / heavy escort: 150-220 m long.
  - Size 7, cruiser / heavy industrial: 260-380 m long.
  - Size 8, capital ship / carrier / battleship: 450-700 m long.
- Station modules may exceed Size 8, but should be produced as modular tiles or separate connected sprites when practical.
- Choose canvas pixel size from the intended length and required detail. For example, a 40 m corvette at 8 px/m should have roughly 320 px of occupied forward length, plus transparent margin.
- If the requested asset would create an impractically large PNG, reduce source pixel density but preserve the intended meter length in the metadata. Do not squash the design.

Orientation and coordinate conventions:
- Ships and forward-facing equipment must point upward on the image: nose at top, main engines at bottom.
- Think of the ship as lying flat on a 2D map. The top of the image is forward/north; the bottom of the image is aft/south.
- Port is image-left, starboard is image-right.
- The ship centerline should be vertical and centered on the canvas.
- If the sprite is asymmetric, keep the forward direction unambiguous with a nose, bridge, weapon arc, or thrust geometry.
- For asteroid/resource sprites, orientation may be irregular, but keep the visual center near the canvas center.

Ship construction language:
- Sidereal ship sprites should feel functional, modular, and industrial: layered hull plates, exposed docking collars, hardpoint sockets, heat vents, sensor masts, cargo spines, armored ribs, and engine bells.
- Use hard sci-fi proportions. Avoid fantasy sails, organic curves, excessive fins, cartoon shapes, retro rocket styling, and decorative wings unless requested for a specific faction.
- Use panel lines and subtle bevels, but avoid photoreal grime that disappears at small scale.
- Leave clear mount points as visible geometry:
  - Weapon hardpoints: small circular, square, or rail sockets on the forward or lateral hull.
  - Engine hardpoints: aft-facing bells/nozzles at the bottom edge.
  - Utility/module hardpoints: rectangular hatches, bays, or collar plates along the center spine or side pods.
  - Turrets should sit on visible bases with enough transparent clearance to be separated later if needed.
- A ship may include visible mounted modules if requested, but do not bake large muzzle flashes, engine plumes, shield effects, or mining beams into the base hull sprite.

Default hardpoint placement by class:
- Fighter/interceptor: 1-2 forward weapon points, 1 aft engine cluster, optional tiny dorsal utility port.
- Shuttle/utility: 0-1 light weapon point, 1 aft engine cluster, 2 side cargo/utility bays.
- Corvette: 1 fore-center weapon point, 1 aft engine hardpoint, 2 side tank/cargo/module positions, 1 central computer/sensor bay.
- Frigate/destroyer: 2-4 forward/lateral weapon points, 2-4 aft engine nozzles, 2-6 utility/module sockets, readable bridge/sensor spine.
- Cruiser/capital: repeated modular bays, multiple turret foundations, separated engine banks, armored core spine, docking/cargo details.

Lighting and rendering:
- Use a consistent top-down sprite lighting model: soft light from upper-left, mild shadowing along lower-right hull edges, and small edge highlights.
- Keep alpha clean. No colored background pixels, no opaque canvas fill, no halo unless explicitly requested as a separate glow sprite.
- Use crisp detail appropriate for pixel/game sprites: controlled anti-aliasing is allowed, but no blurry painterly edges.
- Prefer contrast between structural plates and accent modules. Important sockets and silhouette breaks should still read when downscaled 50%.

Asteroid/resource sprite rules:
- Resource nodes should be top-down irregular rocks, ice chunks, crystals, deposits, or canisters with transparent background.
- Use the resource palette above as embedded veins, chips, glow cracks, or surface patches, not full flat recolors.
- For common asteroid fields, default mix is Iron Ore, Nickel Ore, Silicate Rock, and Rare Earth Oxides.
- Keep fracture-ready silhouettes: larger rocks should look like they can split into 2-5 readable chunks.
- Avoid perfectly round asteroids unless the request is for processed/refined material icons.

Deliverable metadata to include in your response:
- Filename suggestion using lowercase snake_case, for example `military_corvette_01.png`.
- Canvas size in pixels.
- Intended in-game size in meters, especially length and approximate width.
- Source-art density estimate in pixels per meter.
- Forward direction, always "up" for ships.
- A concise hardpoint list with approximate pixel offsets from sprite center, where +Y is forward/up and +X is starboard/right.
- Palette colors used.

Do not:
- Do not render on a black, white, gray, starfield, or checkerboard background. A checkerboard preview pattern is not transparency; the PNG itself must have alpha.
- Do not rotate ships diagonally.
- Do not generate side-view, angled, isometric, perspective, or 3/4-view ships. All ship sprites must be top-down and facing upward.
- Do not make the ship point right or left. Do not place the main engine on the right or left side of the image.
- Do not include visible UI preview chrome such as rounded preview frames, edit buttons, download buttons, or upload buttons.
- Do not include text, logos, watermarks, faction names, or UI overlays in the sprite.
- Do not change the global orientation convention.
- Do not use a one-color monochrome hull unless explicitly requested.
- Do not make resource colors inconsistent with the palette unless the request introduces a new resource.
- Do not imply clients author authoritative gameplay state; visual hardpoints are art annotations only and must remain compatible with server-authored ECS hardpoint data.
```

Example use:

```text
[Paste the full Sidereal Sprite Generation Style Prompt above.]

Create a small military corvette sprite with a compact wedge body, one forward ballistic hardpoint, two side fuel/module pods, and one main aft engine. It should feel like an early-game patrol craft.
```
