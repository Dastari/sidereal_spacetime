## 0. Implementation Status

2026-04-24 status note:

1. Implemented: a Lightyear notification channel carries server-authored notification payloads to the authenticated client for a player.
2. Implemented: native Bevy UI renders notification toasts with `engine-ui` panel, button, and HUD-frame primitives. Default placement is bottom right; top/bottom left/center/right placements are supported.
3. Implemented: notifications are persisted in the SQL `player_notifications` history table keyed by canonical `player_entity_id`.
4. Implemented: landmark discovery emits a non-blocking notification after authoritative server discovery updates `DiscoveredStaticLandmarks`.
5. Implemented: authoritative Lua runtime scripts can request player notifications through `ctx:notify_player(...)`; the host validates and converts requests into server notification commands.
6. Partial/open: no notification history browser is implemented yet, and image rendering currently preserves logical `asset_id` in the payload without adding new image assets or a dedicated toast image resolver.
7. Native impact: active Bevy UI path. WASM impact: protocol and queue model are shared-client compatible; live browser validation remains part of deferred WASM parity follow-through.

2026-04-27 status note:

1. Implemented: when a player successfully enters the world through replication auth binding, the replication server enqueues a `Generic` notification with event type `player_entered_world` for every other currently authenticated player session.
2. The entering player's own session is excluded, and duplicate connected sessions for the same recipient player are collapsed to one persisted/player-scoped notification.
3. Implemented: notification streaming resolves the server transport through each authenticated client's `LinkOf` binding, matching the tactical and owner-manifest lanes. This avoids silently retaining queued notifications when the world has more than one server/link context.
4. Implemented: client and server transport lifecycle systems explicitly attach notification `MessageReceiver`/`MessageSender` components so server-authored notifications exercise the Lightyear notification lane instead of relying only on client-local dev-console injection.
5. Implemented: the replication admin command `notify <player_entity_id> <message>` queues a server-authored generic notification for live-path testing.
6. Native impact: existing Bevy toast UI shows the message. WASM impact: shared notification protocol only; no platform-specific behavior.

2026-04-28 status note:

1. Implemented: server notification delivery and dismissal validation now resolve the authenticated player from the client Bevy entity binding first, then fall back to the transport `RemoteId` binding. This matches the primary authenticated-session shape used by tactical and asset streaming and prevents server-authored notifications from remaining queued when only one of the two auth maps is populated.
2. Clarified: signal detection is not landmark discovery. Long-range gravity-well signal notifications remain redacted tactical/sensor events; direct landmark discovery is the path that persists `DiscoveredStaticLandmarks` and emits the identity-bearing `LandmarkDiscovery` payload.
3. Landmark discovery and long-range gravity-well notifications continue to use the same `NotificationChannel` and client toast UI path; the client remains presentation-only and still filters received messages to its local player entity.
4. Native impact: fixes live server-authored notification delivery for native clients and prevents signal-only unknown contacts from consuming the later direct landmark-discovery notification. WASM impact: shared protocol/server behavior only; no platform-specific notification UI change.

## 1. Contract

Notifications are presentation/history events, not authoritative gameplay state.

Rules:

1. The server authors notification payloads.
2. The client only renders and dismisses notifications for its authenticated selected player.
3. Dismissal messages are validated against the transport session binding before database updates.
4. Critical user-actionable failures remain modal dialogs via `dialog_ui::DialogQueue::push_error()`.
5. Notification payloads may reference logical asset IDs, but replication does not stream image bytes.
6. Notification history is stored in SQL as a player-scoped read/history model. Runtime progression remains on persisted player ECS components.

## 2. Protocol Shape

The notification lane uses:

1. `ServerNotificationMessage`
2. `ClientNotificationDismissedMessage`
3. `NotificationChannel`

`NotificationChannel` is a dedicated ordered reliable presentation lane for server-authored UI/history notifications. It is not the long-term chat/social transport. Future global chat, channels, private communication, mail, or other social infrastructure should use a separate communication/social protocol lane with its own delivery, moderation, history, fanout, and privacy rules, while reusing the toast UI only as one possible presentation surface.

Supported severities:

1. `Info`
2. `Success`
3. `Warning`
4. `Error`

Supported placements:

1. `TopLeft`
2. `TopCenter`
3. `TopRight`
4. `BottomLeft`
5. `BottomCenter`
6. `BottomRight`

Current payload variants:

1. `Generic`
2. `LandmarkDiscovery`

Current generic event types include:

1. `player_entered_world`
2. `long_range_gravity_well_detected`
3. `server_admin_notify_test`

## 3. Persistence

The SQL table is `player_notifications`.

Required fields:

1. `notification_id`
2. `player_entity_id`
3. `notification_kind`
4. `severity`
5. `title`
6. `body`
7. `placement`
8. `payload`
9. `created_at_epoch_s`

Optional fields:

1. `image_asset_id`
2. `image_alt_text`
3. `delivered_at_epoch_s`
4. `dismissed_at_epoch_s`

## 4. UI Behavior

Toasts:

1. use `engine-ui` panel surfaces and HUD frame chrome,
2. include an explicit close button,
3. stack up to five visible toasts per placement,
4. auto-dismiss by severity default unless a payload overrides the duration,
5. use semantic theme colors for severity accents.

Default durations:

1. info: 5 seconds,
2. success: 5 seconds,
3. warning: 7 seconds,
4. error: 9 seconds.

## 5. Lua Boundary

Scripts request notifications through validated host intent APIs only.

Example:

```lua
ctx:notify_player({
  player_entity_id = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
  title = "Objective Updated",
  body = "Return to station.",
  severity = "info",
  placement = "bottom_right",
  event_type = "objective_update",
  data = { objective_id = "starter_return" },
})
```

Lua does not receive UI handles, database handles, or client authority.
