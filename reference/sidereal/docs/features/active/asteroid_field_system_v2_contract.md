## 0. Implementation Status

- 2026-08-31: The starter V2 field root and its eager members are now generated from the
  `maw` universe baseline's `maw.starter_field` zone rather than from `world_init.lua`.
  `layout_seed` participates in spatial and visual sampling, so changing it rerolls the
  field while deterministic member keys remain stable. Native/WASM impact: both clients
  consume the same replicated field/member components; authority remains on the owning
  shard and no platform branch was added.

- 2026-06-01: Damage-driven progressive fracture is implemented and supersedes the §6 random-offset child split for *damaged* members: hits accumulate per-octant stress on `AsteroidMemberDamage`, the rock cracks along a deterministic 7-site latent Voronoi network (shader crack pass), and stressed exterior convex cells detach as staged fragments with a shrinking `attached_cells_mask`, plus shatter dust VFX. Pacing/thresholds/caps are Lua-authored on `AsteroidFractureProfile`; fragments are currently terminal. The zero-health fracture path remains the terminal fallback. See `docs/features/implemented/asteroid_damage_driven_fracture_implemented.md`. Native impact: damaged members visibly crack and calve chunks. WASM impact: builds clean on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (`bevy/webgpu`); fracture/network logic stays target-shared, presentation stays in shared shader/client code.
- 2026-04-26: V2 supersedes the earlier V1 field-root proposal as the active implementation direction. Implemented in the first V2 slice: `asteroid.field` root authoring, V2 field/member/resource/fracture/ambient components, linked eager starter members, deterministic member/child key helpers, zero-health member fracture into linked child entities, field damage-state updates, procedural sprite style extensions, and asteroid shader style pass. Still pending: proximity activation/retirement, client-side ambient field blending, mining/extraction actions, and dashboard/editor V2 surfaces. Native impact: shared/server fracture is active; native client rendering consumes the updated procedural sprite/shader payloads. WASM impact: gameplay/procedural/fracture logic remains target-shared; platform differences stay at asset/render/transport boundaries.
- 2026-04-28: Replication hydration now seeds Bevy `Transform` from persisted `avian_position`/`avian_rotation` before physics systems see hydrated entities. This prevents static Avian asteroid members from treating default transform `(0,0)` as authoritative and then persisting collapsed positions after a server restart. Native impact: restarted replication servers should preserve V2 member placement. WASM impact: server-side hydration fix only.
- 2026-04-28: The asteroid shader now makes macro spherical lighting dominant over generated normal-map relief and reduces UV-local bright albedo/ridge variation. Native impact: field members should show a consistent star-facing lit side rather than random bright patches. WASM impact: shader-only behavior change within the existing asteroid material contract.
- 2026-04-28: V2 asteroid materials now include parent rotation in their shader uniform data, and `asteroid.wgsl` transforms world/local light vectors into local normal-map space. Native impact: rotated and spinning asteroid members should preserve a consistent world light direction. WASM impact: asteroid material bindings changed without adding target-specific code.
- 2026-04-27: Starter V2 members now use browner default procedural palettes with weaker ore-accent mixing, smoother generated silhouettes, and post-smoothed collision outlines. Native impact: field members should look less grey/confetti-like and their debug collision outlines should be less jagged while remaining derived from the same deterministic sprite payload. WASM impact: shared script payloads and generator behavior changed only.
- 2026-04-27: The asteroid sprite shader was retuned toward the V2 visual direction by removing shader-side pixel-grid sampling, desaturating procedural albedo to grey stone, and relying on generated normal relief plus shared world lighting for crater/facet readability. Native impact: asteroid members and fracture children should read closer to lit top-down rock sprites. WASM impact: no new material binding; shader/cache parity must remain intact.
- 2026-04-27: V2 member visuals now feed generated normal-map textures into the dedicated asteroid material so field asteroids and fracture children use the same shared world-lighting/bump response. Starter field density and size defaults were also tuned toward denser, larger, split-capable rocks. Native impact: denser starter field and more relief-driven asteroid shading. WASM impact: shared material bindings changed; browser builds must use the same asteroid shader contract.

## 1. Purpose

Asteroid-heavy regions should be authored and reasoned about as coherent world features, not only as a flat list of unrelated rocks. V2 makes an asteroid field a durable gameplay entity with an authored center, radius, shape, density, clusters, seed, deterministic member slots, server-authoritative fracture, field-owned depletion/resource state, and optional ambient presentation when the player enters the field.

## 2. Relationship To V1

`system.asteroid_field.v1` means the legacy eager member model:

1. a world bootstrap script calls `spawn_bundle_graph_records("asteroid.field_member", ...)`.
2. Each asteroid is persisted as an independent entity.
3. Procedural sprites and collision outlines are deterministic from the entity id and `procedural_sprite`.
4. No root field entity owns density, resource, fracture, or depletion state.

`system.asteroid_field.v2` keeps the successful V1 rendering/collision pieces, but changes the authoring and authority model:

1. universe-baseline field zones place `asteroid.field` root entities;
2. members carry `AsteroidFieldMember` linkage;
3. fracture/depletion writes back to field-owned state keyed by deterministic member keys;
4. resource/ore composition is authored as field/member profile data, not hardcoded Rust tables.

`asteroid.field_member` stays as a migration helper and isolated-rock authoring path until field-root activation fully replaces eager spawning.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Rules

1. The server decides member spawning, health loss, fracture, depletion, and mining output.
2. Clients never authoritatively split asteroids or create resource outputs.
3. Field/member identity crossing scripts, persistence, replication, and UI uses UUIDs or deterministic string keys, never raw Bevy `Entity` IDs.
4. Persisted field/member state uses graph records/components and graph relationships where relationships are needed.
5. Active asteroid members reuse existing generic components where applicable: `HealthPool`, `Destructible`, `MassKg`, `SizeM`, collision components, `VisualAssetId`, `SpriteShaderAssetId`, `ProceduralSprite`, and Avian motion components.
6. Ore/resource composition is data-authored through Lua profiles and stable logical IDs such as `item_id` and `extraction_profile_id`.
7. Fracture uses fixed-step simulation flow. Frame-time deltas are presentation-only.
8. Field ambient dust/background/foreground effects are presentation support only. They must not mutate authoritative motion, visibility, mining, or depletion state.

## 4. Entity Model

### 4.1 Field Root

The primary authored primitive is `asteroid.field`. It emits one persisted root entity with:

1. `AsteroidField`;
2. `AsteroidFieldLayout`;
3. `AsteroidFieldPopulation`;
4. `AsteroidFieldDamageState`;
5. optional `AsteroidFieldAmbient`;
6. normal public metadata such as `DisplayName`, `EntityLabels`, `MapIcon`, `WorldPosition`, and `WorldRotation`.

The root is the durable owner of layout, density, resource profile selection, fracture policy selection, and depletion history.

### 4.2 Active Members

Active members are ordinary gameplay entities while they are interactable. They carry generic gameplay components for health, destruction, mass, collision, visuals, and motion plus `AsteroidFieldMember` for field linkage and deterministic lineage.

The starter field still eagerly spawns all initial members from its baseline generator.
Every member has root linkage and deterministic member keys, so later
activation/retirement can be added without changing the member schema.

## 6. Fracture Contract

> **Evolution (2026-06-01):** the zero-health → random-offset child model below is
> the shipped baseline. The intended V2 fracture is **damage-driven, progressive**:
> damage accumulates at impact sites, the rock cracks along a deterministic latent
> fracture network, and convex fragments shed along the failed crack lines (slow
> break-apart) with convex-hull colliders. See
> `docs/features/implemented/asteroid_damage_driven_fracture_implemented.md`. The contract below remains the
> fallback/terminal behaviour and the source of the deterministic key rules.

Fracture is triggered when an active member with `AsteroidFieldMember`, `HealthPool`, and a fracture-capable profile reaches zero health.

Resolution order:

1. read parent `AsteroidFieldMember`, `HealthPool`, `MassKg`, `SizeM`, position, velocity, and fracture profile;
2. update the owning root `AsteroidFieldDamageState` by `member_key`;
3. derive child count and child keys from field id, parent key, content version, and child index;
4. write child state entries before spawning child entities;
5. spawn child entities one size tier smaller with deterministic offsets, reduced mass, derived health, related `ProceduralSprite`, and normal collision components;
6. mark the parent `Fractured` or `Depleted`;
7. despawn or tombstone the parent runtime entity.

Baseline tier behavior:

1. `Massive` -> `Large`;
2. `Large` -> `Medium`;
3. `Medium` -> `Small`;
4. `Small` -> terminal depletion, no more physics children.

Child total mass must be less than or equal to parent remaining mass multiplied by the profile's mass retention ratio. The remainder represents dust, lost fragments, or future resource output.

## 7. Visual Direction

V2 asteroids should read as a top-down space ARPG sprite style rather than soft spherical PBR rocks.

Shader and generator requirements:

1. chunkier silhouettes with chipped facets;
2. more visible shape families: rocky, carbonaceous, metallic, shard-like, and gem-rich;
3. posterized lighting bands;
4. darker readable rim/edge shading;
5. cracks and craters that survive sprite scaling;
6. controlled pixelation/quantization rather than blurry noise;
7. mineral accents driven by procedural sprite/resource profile data.

`data/shaders/asteroid.wgsl` remains a world-sprite shader. It uses the dedicated asteroid material contract: albedo texture, linear generated normal texture, and `SharedWorldLightingUniforms`. It should improve the style within that contract instead of adding a new ad-hoc material path.

## 8. Lua Authoring

V2 Lua authoring surfaces:

1. `data/scripts/asteroids/registry.lua`
   - field profiles;
   - sprite profiles;
   - fracture profiles;
   - resource profiles;
   - ambient profiles.
2. `asteroid.field`
   - emits root entity and V2 components;
   - may eagerly emit linked member entities during Phase 1.
3. `asteroid.field_member`
   - remains for isolated rocks and migration comparison;
   - should emit `AsteroidFieldMember` when called from a field root context.

Rust validates Lua-authored asteroid profiles. Lua owns tuning and content selection; Rust owns schema, deterministic generation, damage/fracture resolution, resource transactions, persistence, and replication.

## 9. Resource And Mining Readiness

V2 does not need to finish mining gameplay, but it must not block it.

Resource profile rules:

1. resources are stable logical `item_id` values;
2. yield weights and depletion pools live on field/member resource profiles;
3. clients may receive coarse public labels later, but exact yields are server-owned unless intentionally disclosed;
4. extraction actions in future mining gameplay consume member/field depletion state and trigger inventory/mass recomputation through the resources/crafting contract.

## 10. Ambient Field Presentation

Fields may define an ambient profile that the client can use when the camera or controlled entity enters the field volume.

Supported presentation hooks:

1. fullscreen background shader option;
2. fullscreen foreground shader option;
3. camera-scoped dust/post-process shader option;
4. fade-in and fade-out by distance from the field boundary.

The initial implementation may select one nearest/highest-intensity field. Later work can add blending between overlapping fields.

## 11. Phased Delivery

Phase 1: implemented foundation

1. add V2 docs and components;
2. extend procedural sprite schema and shader style;
3. add `asteroid.field` bundle and convert starter world bootstrap;
4. keep eager member spawning, but with root/member linkage.

Phase 2: partially implemented fracture

1. zero-health fracture resolution is implemented for active field members;
2. parent/child lineage and field damage-state updates are implemented in ECS state;
3. deterministic child generation tests are implemented;
4. persistence/hydration regression coverage for restarted worlds remains pending.

Phase 3:

1. add cluster activation/retirement;
2. keep only relevant members hydrated;
3. write retired member state back to the root.

Phase 4:

1. connect mining/extraction runtime;
2. expose tactical/editor surfaces;
3. add richer ambient/profile blending.

## 12. Tests

Required coverage:

1. component metadata for all new V2 components;
2. serde roundtrip of nested layout, population, damage, fracture, and resource payloads;
3. deterministic member and child key generation;
4. fracture mass/health/depth limits;
5. Lua registry validation and starter bundle smoke tests;
6. replication/server tests for parent destruction -> child spawn lifecycle;
7. native client visual validation and WASM compile check when client/shared runtime changes.
