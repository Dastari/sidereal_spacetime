## 0. Status Notes

- 2026-09-07: Physical-character inventory, grid containers, equipment, placement and transaction recommendations are now detailed in `docs/features/proposed/character_inventory_and_interaction_proposal.md`. That proposal connects this industrial economy to construction Phase 2 fuel/power and the native/WASM client; it is not an implemented item or crafting runtime. Preserve the material/recipe/facility ladder here.
- 2026-04-24: Not implemented yet as a full resource/crafting runtime. Existing implemented foundations include `Inventory`, dynamic mass components (`CargoMassKg`, `ModuleMassKg`, `TotalMassKg`), mounted-module mass derivation, graph persistence, and Lua bundle/catalog infrastructure. Missing: item/resource/recipe/facility catalogs, extraction/salvage systems, queue progression, crafting transactions, manufacturing jobs, and UI flows. Native/WASM impact: future authoritative systems must remain server/shared-code driven with platform differences limited to UI and input.
- 2026-04-26: Asteroid Field System V2 introduces the first concrete extraction-source shape for future mining: field/member resource profiles with logical `item_id` yield tables, depletion pools, and `extraction_profile_id` references. Mining and inventory output transactions remain future work, but asteroid resource composition must be Lua-authored and server-validated rather than hardcoded in Rust. Native impact: field/member resource state will be consumed by future native mining UI and gameplay. WASM impact: no browser authority split; clients consume shared replicated/public metadata only.
- 2026-04-26: The initial V2 implementation stores asteroid resource profiles on field roots and links active members to resource profile ids. Zero-health fracture updates field damage state but does not yet mint inventory resources; mining/extraction actions remain the future server-authoritative path for turning depletion into inventory outputs.
- 2026-03-16: Initial contract for Sidereal's material, refining, and crafting foundation. Native impact: future shared gameplay/runtime work is required for extraction nodes, facility queues, inventory transactions, and module/ship manufacturing flows. WASM impact: no browser-only authority split is introduced; recipe validation, queue progression, and item/facility definitions should remain in shared gameplay/runtime code, with browser differences limited to UI/input and asset-loading boundaries.

## 1. Purpose

Sidereal needs a resource and crafting model that supports the whole industrial ladder of a top-down space ARPG:

1. extraction from asteroids, ice fields, wrecks, stations, and anomaly regions,
2. refining and chemical processing,
3. alloy/composite/synthetic production,
4. module-grade and hull-grade subassemblies,
5. downstream manufacture of ships, weapons, upgrades, ammunition, drones, and faction-specific gear.

This document defines the target direction for:

1. the content taxonomy,
2. the data-authoring model,
3. the Bevy/runtime integration contract,
4. the starter material tree and progression bands.

## 2. Design Goals

### 2.1 Gameplay goals

1. Common items should craft through short readable chains, while advanced faction/endgame outputs can use deeper industrial chains.
2. Real-ish materials should make the economy legible at a glance.
3. Fictional materials should provide Sidereal-specific faction identity and endgame flavor.
4. Crafting should be a foundation for combat, traversal, logistics, and progression rather than a disconnected side system.

### 2.2 Architecture goals

1. Keep authority server-side for extraction, refining, queue progression, recipe validation, and output creation.
2. Keep content authoring data-driven and mod-friendly through Lua-authored registries rather than Rust hardcoded content tables.
3. Keep runtime state on authoritative ECS entities and persist it through graph records.
4. Keep shared item/recipe/facility definitions available to both native and WASM clients without platform-specific gameplay forks.

### 2.3 Production-graph goals

1. Tier 0-1 should cover mining, salvage, pumping, and basic refining.
2. Tier 2-3 should define the industrial backbone used by most ship, weapon, and module recipes.
3. Tier 4-5 should provide faction-specialized and endgame material identities.
4. Recommended chain depth:
   - common outputs: 2 steps,
   - mid-game outputs: 3 steps,
   - rare or faction outputs: 4-5 steps.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Invariants

1. Client input may request extraction/crafting actions, but clients never authoritatively create materials, advance jobs, or spawn finished equipment.
2. Item, recipe, facility, and extraction definitions are content data, not ad hoc Rust constant maps.
3. Sidereal should follow the existing Lua-authored catalog model used elsewhere in the project: authoritative definitions live in script catalogs, Rust validates them, and runtime systems consume generated registries/resources.
4. Durable runtime state such as facility inventories, queue entries, unlock state, and extraction depletion belongs on graph-persisted ECS entities/components, not side SQL tables that bypass the ECS authority model.
5. Logical crafting identities crossing script/UI/network boundaries use stable IDs such as `item_id`, `recipe_id`, `facility_id`, and `blueprint_id`; raw Bevy `Entity` IDs must not cross those boundaries.
6. Fixed-step simulation resources drive extraction rates, queue progress, fuel/power consumption, and manufacturing timers. Frame deltas are UI-only.
7. Cargo mass/value must remain compatible with the existing mass-derivation direction: item definitions must expose canonical unit mass, and authoritative inventory/crafting mutations must trigger derived mass recomputation on the owning entity tree.
8. Modules, weapons, ships, and mounted equipment remain real ECS entity archetypes with graph-record bootstrap/hydration. Crafting should produce stackable materials, subassemblies, deployables, blueprint unlocks, or validated spawn jobs; it must not bypass the existing entity/bundle model.
9. Extraction and salvage logic must stay generic over entity families. Do not hardcode ship-only or asteroid-only terminology into shared resource/crafting runtime structures.

## 4. High-Level Model

### 4.1 Two-layer model: content catalogs and runtime state

The system should be split into two clear layers:

1. **Content catalogs**
   - item definitions,
   - recipe definitions,
   - facility definitions,
   - extraction/salvage yield profile definitions,
   - faction recipe-set and unlock definitions.
2. **Runtime state**
   - inventories on entities,
   - facility queues on stations/ships/outposts,
   - extraction depletion on resource entities/fields,
   - player/faction/station unlock state,
   - spawned finished items or graph-template manufacturing jobs.

Catalog data is shared read-only reference data.
Runtime state is authoritative ECS state.

### 4.2 Item classes

Sidereal should keep a readable item taxonomy:

1. `raw_mineral`
2. `raw_volatile`
3. `raw_biological`
4. `refined_material`
5. `chemical_feedstock`
6. `alloy`
7. `composite`
8. `synthetic`
9. `exotic_material`
10. `subassembly`
11. `ammo`
12. `equipment_kit`
13. `blueprint`
14. `end_product`

This keeps early mining/cargo readable while still allowing module-grade and shipyard-grade outputs later.

### 4.3 Content-authoring ownership

Canonical direction:

1. `data/scripts/economy/item_registry.lua`
2. `data/scripts/economy/recipe_registry.lua`
3. `data/scripts/economy/facility_registry.lua`
4. `data/scripts/economy/extraction_profiles.lua`

Rust should load, validate, and expose these through runtime registries/resources derived from the active script catalog, following the same ownership split already documented for assets and bundles.

Rust owns:

1. schema validation,
2. dependency graph validation,
3. fixed-step queue execution,
4. inventory transaction rules,
5. entity spawning/bootstrap for finished ships/modules/equipment,
6. persistence and replication rules.

Lua owns:

1. item lists,
2. recipe inputs/outputs,
3. facility capabilities,
4. faction flavor and unlock tables,
5. authored extraction yield tables,
6. progression tuning and content balance values.

## 5. Canonical Authoring Shape

The user's JSON-like starter schema is directionally correct, but Sidereal's canonical authoring surface should be Lua catalogs rather than JSON blobs embedded in Rust.

### 5.1 Item registry shape

Illustrative shape:

```lua
return {
  schema_version = 1,
  items = {
    {
      item_id = "resource.iron_ore",
      display_name = "Iron Ore",
      category = "raw_mineral",
      rarity = "common",
      tier = 0,
      fictional = false,
      stack_size = 100,
      unit_mass_kg = 2.0,
      base_value = 4,
      tags = { "ore", "metal" },
      sources = { "rocky_asteroid", "planetary_crust" },
      used_in = { "material.iron_ingots" },
      description = "Common ferrous ore used across hull and weapon production.",
    },
  },
}
```

### 5.2 Recipe registry shape

Illustrative shape:

```lua
return {
  schema_version = 1,
  recipes = {
    {
      recipe_id = "recipe.alloy.aetherium_alloy",
      facility_id = "advanced_alloy_forge",
      output = { item_id = "material.aetherium_alloy", amount = 1 },
      inputs = {
        { item_id = "material.titanium_alloy", amount = 2 },
        { item_id = "material.aetherite_shards", amount = 1 },
      },
      craft_time_s = 20,
      power_cost = 8,
      unlocks = { "metallurgy_3" },
      tags = { "alloy", "advanced_structure", "energy_conductive" },
    },
  },
}
```

### 5.3 Facility registry shape

Illustrative shape:

```lua
return {
  schema_version = 1,
  facilities = {
    {
      facility_id = "advanced_alloy_forge",
      display_name = "Advanced Alloy Forge",
      categories = { "alloy", "exotic_material" },
      queue_slots = 2,
      allowed_recipe_tags = { "alloy", "advanced_structure" },
      power_buffer_mw = 10,
    },
  },
}
```

### 5.4 Rust mirror types

Runtime loaders/resources should use strongly typed shared structs along the lines of:

```rust
pub struct ItemDef {
    pub item_id: String,
    pub display_name: String,
    pub category: ItemCategory,
    pub rarity: Rarity,
    pub tier: u8,
    pub fictional: bool,
    pub stack_size: u32,
    pub unit_mass_kg: f32,
    pub base_value: u32,
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
    pub sources: Vec<String>,
    pub used_in: Vec<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
}

pub struct RecipeDef {
    pub recipe_id: String,
    pub facility_id: String,
    pub inputs: Vec<RecipeInput>,
    pub output: RecipeOutput,
    pub craft_time_s: u32,
    pub power_cost: u32,
    pub unlocks: Vec<String>,
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
}
```

The exact type names can change, but the shared-definition pattern should not.

## 6. Bevy and ECS Integration Contract

### 6.1 Runtime resources

The Bevy app should eventually expose read-only definition resources such as:

1. `ItemCatalogResource`
2. `RecipeCatalogResource`
3. `FacilityCatalogResource`
4. `ExtractionProfileCatalogResource`

These are authoritative runtime mirrors of validated Lua content, not hand-maintained gameplay tables.

### 6.2 Persisted gameplay components

Expected component families include:

1. `Inventory`
   - entity-local item stacks and quantities,
   - persisted and owner-replicated by existing inventory policy.
2. `CraftingFacility`
   - facility type/capabilities on a station, ship module, or colony structure.
3. `CraftingQueue`
   - active recipe jobs, progress, reserved inputs, output staging, power/fuel requirements.
4. `RecipeUnlocks`
   - player/faction/station-scoped unlock state.
5. `ExtractionNode` or `ResourceYieldProfile`
   - links world entities to yield tables and depletion behavior.
6. `ManufacturingJob`
   - validated job describing a future entity spawn or kit output for ships/modules/weapons.

These should follow the normal component workflow in `docs/guides/component_authoring_guide.md`: one file per primary component, `#[sidereal_component(...)]`, reflection + serde, graph persistence, and tests.

### 6.3 Inventory identity contract

2026-09-07 proposed refinement: use catalog `item_id` for definitions and UUIDs for unique instances or homogeneous stacks, with one authoritative location per instance. Store grid/equipment/mount placement separately from the item's definition and state. Splitting/merging, installing, refilling and crafting use atomic owner-shard transactions. The detailed proposal in `docs/features/proposed/character_inventory_and_interaction_proposal.md` supplies the recommended resolution of the identity and portable-kit questions below; these choices still require implementation and validation.

Current docs already expose inventory operations in terms of `item_id`, while the current `InventoryEntry` Rust shape still carries an item UUID field.

Target direction:

1. recipe evaluation, script APIs, UI, pricing, and economy logic should resolve stackable goods by stable `item_id`,
2. if inventory retains UUID-backed entries for unique items later, those entries must still resolve to a canonical catalog `item_id` for crafting/economy operations,
3. crafting must never depend on raw Bevy entity handles inside recipe definitions.

### 6.4 Fixed-step systems

Expected authoritative systems:

1. extraction tick system,
2. salvage/loot conversion system,
3. crafting queue progression system,
4. inventory reservation/commit system,
5. mass dirtying + recomputation trigger path,
6. manufacturing completion system,
7. station/faction demand and price update hooks.

These run in fixed schedules and mutate authoritative ECS state only on the server/host authority side.

### 6.5 Downstream output model

Crafting outputs should support three downstream classes:

1. **Stack outputs**
   - ore, ingots, acids, polymers, ammo, circuit packs, armor plates.
2. **Kit outputs**
   - module kits, hull kits, weapon kits, drone kits.
3. **Manufacturing jobs**
   - validated outputs that spawn graph-record-backed entities or multi-entity archetypes through the existing bundle/template path.

This preserves Sidereal's current entity model for ships and mounted modules while still allowing industrial crafting to feed those outputs.

## 7. Facility Ladder

Recommended facility roster:

1. `extractor`
   - mining drills, gas pumps, salvage rigs.
2. `smelter`
   - metal and mineral refining.
3. `chemical_refinery`
   - volatile separation, acids, coolants, fuels.
4. `polymer_plant`
   - plastics and resin feedstocks.
5. `composite_fabricator`
   - carbon fiber, ceramic matrix, stealth fabrics, gels.
6. `advanced_alloy_forge`
   - exotic alloys and high-grade structural materials.
7. `biotech_vat`
   - living polymers, fungal gels, symbiotic tissue.
8. `capital_forge`
   - endgame hull plating, engine casings, citadel-grade armor.
9. `drydock`
   - ship hull and large module manufacturing jobs.

Facilities are capabilities on entities, not free-floating global menus.

1. **Industrial / human**
   - Steel, Titanium Alloy, Ceramic Matrix Composite, Duralumin.
2. **Stealth / pirate / black-ops**
   - Voidsteel, Void Weave, Phase Mesh, Phase Nickel.
3. **High-tech / energy**
   - Aetherium Alloy, Aetherglass, Neurogel.
4. **Heavy military**
   - Gravimetal, Cryoceramic, Neutronium Laminate, Citadel Armor.
5. **Biotech / alien**
   - Sunspine Bioplastic, Graviflex, Symbiotic Ship Tissue.

## 12. Downstream Equipment Foundation

The material tree should become the common input language for all major crafted outputs:

1. **Ships**
   - hull plates,
   - engine casings,
   - armor segments,
   - cockpit/canopy optics,
   - drydock kit outputs.
2. **Weapons**
   - barrel alloys,
   - capacitor housings,
   - recoil frames,
   - specialty emitters and sensor meshes.
3. **Upgrades and modules**
   - flight computers,
   - sensor suites,
   - stealth linings,
   - shield/energy assemblies,
   - biotech control substrates.
4. **Ammunition and consumables**
   - ballistic rounds,
   - missiles,
   - volatile warheads,
   - coolant packs,
   - fuel cells.

Guideline:

1. ammunition should usually use shallow chains,
2. common ship modules should use the Tier 2-3 backbone,
3. faction-signature modules should consume Tier 4-5 materials,
4. capital-ship recipes should be drydock/capital-forge scale rather than ordinary inventory crafting.

## 13. Open Policy Questions

1. Final inventory payload shape for stackables: direct `item_id` stacks, UUID-backed entries with `item_id` resolution, or a hybrid model.
2. Exact split between portable crafted kits and direct facility manufacturing jobs for ships and mounted modules.
3. Exact station/faction unlock ownership model: player-only, faction-shared, station-local, or mixed.
4. Exact resource depletion and regrowth rules for mining regions, wreck salvage, and anomaly harvesting.
5. Exact price model and whether `base_value` is only authoring guidance or an authoritative economy seed input.
6. Whether recipes can support byproducts, catalysts, and probabilistic yields in V1 or should stay deterministic first.

## 14. Edit Checklist

For future implementation work touching resources/crafting:

1. Verify item/recipe/facility definitions remain Lua-authored and Rust-validated.
2. Verify queue/extraction state remains on persisted ECS entities or graph-related records, not side tables.
3. Verify inventory and crafting outputs trigger cargo/mass recomputation on affected entities.
4. Verify client/UI paths consume logical IDs and authoritative replicated state rather than local-only crafting simulation.
5. Verify native and WASM clients still compile against the same shared gameplay definition/runtime code.
6. Update this contract, related scripting docs, and background economy docs when the runtime model hardens further.
