## 0. Status Notes

- 2026-08-31: Durable planet definitions live as JSON registry-definition packages under
  `data/content/planets/`, and all eight starter bodies are explicit placements in the
  `maw` universe baseline. `world_init.lua` no longer spawns planet bodies. Native/WASM
  clients continue to consume the same shared replicated component and shader paths.

- 2026-05-29: The procedural cell-shaded planet/star/space-backdrop shader stack is now catalogued as `system.genesis_shader.v1` in `docs/systems/core_systems_catalog_v1.md`. The proposed field-and-classify evolution is `system.genesis_shader.v2`, specified in `docs/features/proposed/genesis_shader_system_v2_proposal.md` (planet "type" becomes a region of coupled elevation/temperature/moisture parameter space, preserving this system's fixed `PlanetBodyUniforms` ABI and Lua registry/genesis/preset pipeline). No native/WASM/authority impact from the documentation change.

- 2026-04-24: Genesis planet registry implementation has started. Starter planet/celestial definitions are moving into `data/scripts/planets/registry.lua` plus one Lua file per named body, with `world_init.lua` consuming validated registry entries through the existing `planet.body` bundle. Native impact: no render ABI change; authored starter content still spawns as static `WorldPosition`/`WorldRotation` planet entities. WASM impact: no platform split; future browser exposure is dashboard tooling and shared shader preview only.
- 2026-04-24: Current implementation is live for static non-physics planet/celestial entities using `WorldPosition`/`WorldRotation`, Lua bundle authoring, persisted shader settings, runtime world layers, and client layered planet rendering. Not implemented: full galaxy/solar-system membership, orbital simulation, or physics participation for planets. Native impact: active visual path. WASM impact: shared render/schema path should remain target-compatible; live browser validation remains deferred behind native stabilization.
- 2026-04-24: Server visibility/discovery now indexes static planet/celestial landmarks from `WorldPosition` directly instead of relying first on Bevy `GlobalTransform`. This fixes off-origin discoverable planets being treated as if they were still at a stale/default transform position during discovery/delivery. Native impact: remote/off-origin planets can appear when discovered near their authoritative world location. WASM impact: server-side fix applies equally to later browser clients.
- 2026-04-24: Client planet visual children now compensate for their authoritative off-origin parent transform before applying camera-relative parallax placement. This keeps planets such as Aurelia renderable through the planet-body camera even though the replicated root remains at the real world position. Native impact: fixes off-origin planet visuals that had spawned passes/materials but rendered outside the planet camera view. WASM impact: shared client visual path; no platform split.
- 2026-04-24: `planet_visual.wgsl` now keeps the existing Rust/Lua/dashboard ABI but replaces the older animated 4D value-noise helper with cheaper time-evolving domain-warped 3D fBm for animated cloud/star flows, adds cellular crater shaping for rocky bodies, derives body normal perturbation from screen-space height derivatives instead of extra height resamples, and smooths terminator lighting for more believable twilight atmosphere. Native impact: active visual path. WASM impact: shared shader asset path with no platform-specific branch.
- 2026-04-24: Planet cloud rendering now uses an explicit planet-type branch so terran and gas cloud density paths are not both evaluated, simplifies the terran weather field, tightens the cloud shell radius, and lowers the Lua-authored cloud pass scale for starter planet content. Native impact: active planet visual path. WASM impact: shared shader/Lua data path with no platform-specific branch.
- 2026-04-28: `planet_visual.wgsl` star rendering now avoids longitude-unwrapped noise for star surface/corona fields, clamps and fades stellar corona before the quad edge, adds finer photosphere granulation, biases star color grading toward deeper orange mids, and gives star bodies more in-material corona space for radial streamer/tendril prominences. Normal planet saturation/contrast response is also reduced so authored planets are less washed out. Native impact: active planet/star visual path. WASM impact: shared shader asset path; dashboard preview uses the same source shader.
- 2026-04-28: Helion's authored star palette now separates hot primary gold, orange secondary, deep ember tertiary, and red-orange atmosphere/emissive colors. The active star shader also applies stronger detail-driven dark convection lanes and honors star saturation/contrast settings so surface structure survives tone mapping instead of flattening into a uniform yellow disc. Native impact: active starter star visual path. WASM impact: same Lua/shader source feeds dashboard preview and browser-compatible shader validation.
- 2026-04-28: Star shader hue bias now comes from authored color fields only. The shader no longer multiplies star colors by hidden yellow/orange RGB tints, so setting all Genesis star color controls to white produces neutral white procedural shading. Genesis also exposes the tertiary and night-light color channels alongside primary, secondary, atmosphere, clouds, and emissive. Native impact: active starter star visual path. WASM impact: dashboard preview and shared shader source stay in parity.
- 2026-04-28: Star photosphere detail now layers screen-disc convection cells over the sphere-space flow to avoid center-pole convergence artifacts. Corona prominences are now one-sided limb lobes that extend outward from the stellar edge instead of symmetric quad-space arcs. A neutral authored-color guard forces near-grayscale star palettes back to luminance after star grading so all-white Genesis controls remain visually neutral. Native impact: active starter star visual path. WASM impact: dashboard preview fetches shader source with cache bypass and uses the shared shader source.
- 2026-04-28: The star corona path now treats prominences as an edge-emitted polar plasma field rather than a detached atmosphere/cloud shell. Corona alpha starts at the authored star radius, flare length varies by angle, radial filament bands taper outward from the limb, and color/alpha are tied to the same density field to avoid smoky detached blobs and hard gaps. Native impact: active starter star visual path. WASM impact: shared shader source and dashboard preview path.
- 2026-04-28: Star rendering is now split into its own `star_visual.wgsl` asset and `world_polygon_star` shader family while retaining the same `PlanetBodyShaderSettings` uniform ABI for this migration step. `planet_visual.wgsl` remains the active planet/cloud/ring/black-hole path; stars should author `planet_visual_shader_asset_id = "star_visual_wgsl"`. Native impact: client body passes choose `StarVisualMaterial` for star shader assets. WASM impact: Genesis and shader-preview validation load the new star source through the same browser-compatible shader catalog path.
- 2026-04-28: Planet projected render culling now treats an unavailable planet-body camera viewport as visible instead of culled. This prevents the planet visual children from being hidden during camera/viewport initialization or transient viewport loss while the tactical/minimap lane can still know about the body. Native impact: planet/star visual passes should not disappear solely because the secondary planet camera has not reported a logical viewport. WASM impact: shared client visual contract; live browser validation remains deferred.
- 2026-04-29: Replication runtime planet-registry sync now reapplies current registry-derived visual, layer, landmark, and signal components to all live registry-backed celestial entities, not only star entries. This lets existing development databases pick up current Aurelia/Helion visual stacks and discovery classification after script reload instead of requiring a reseed. Native impact: starter planet/star visuals and tactical discovery metadata are repaired at runtime. WASM impact: shared replicated component state only.
- 2026-03-09: Native client planet visuals no longer apply camera-driven x/y parallax offsets on top of the authoritative planet root transform. Planets still render on a lower z/depth layer, but the visible disc center now remains aligned with the replicated world position so AABB/debug overlays and selection stay correct away from camera center. WASM impact: shared client visual behavior change; no platform-specific divergence intended.
- 2026-03-09: Native client planet visuals now use a client-only projected render-center offset derived from the authoritative planet world position plus camera position. The authoritative planet root remains fixed at the real world center for visibility/exploration/culling decisions, while the visual child offset restores layer parallax for drawing only. WASM impact: shared client visual behavior change; no platform-specific divergence intended.
- 2026-03-09: Runtime world layers now also support an optional `screen_scale_factor` used by the native planet visual path. This changes apparent planet size for the layer without changing authoritative world position or adding extra parallax. It does not by itself fix projected render-frustum culling; projected visual bounds still need a dedicated follow-up.
- 2026-03-09: Native client planet passes now opt out of Bevy frustum culling and use client-side projected landmark bounds against the gameplay camera viewport plus buffer instead. That keeps parallaxed planets, rings, and clouds visible until their projected disc actually leaves the buffered view, while still allowing planet-local lighting and other `ViewVisibility` consumers to drop out once the projected landmark is offscreen. WASM impact: shared client visual behavior change; no platform-specific divergence intended.
- 2026-03-09: Replication delivery for discovered parallaxed planets now widens landmark delivery by the authored layer `parallax_factor` and bypasses the normal spatial candidate prefilter for already-discovered landmarks. This keeps the server from dropping a planet while its projected render center is still inside the buffered gameplay viewport. WASM impact: transport-agnostic authoritative visibility behavior change; no platform-specific divergence intended.

## 1. Runtime Model

Planets are authoritative world entities generated from typed registry package data and
baseline placements, then rendered on the client through a layered 2D shader path.

- Authoritative content authoring lives in durable packages and the universe baseline:
  - `data/content/planets/*/{manifest.json,definition.json}`
  - `data/content/universes/maw/placements/*.json`
  - `data/scripts/bundles/starter/planet_body.lua`
  - `data/scripts/assets/registry.lua`
- Shared schema lives in Rust:
  - `PlanetBodyShaderSettings`
- Client rendering lives in 2D billboard material families:
  - `data/shaders/planet_visual.wgsl`
  - `data/shaders/star_visual.wgsl`

This keeps art direction and per-body tuning in structured content while Rust owns
validation, replication schema, render plumbing, and shader execution. Shader delivery is
still data-authored via `sprite_shader_asset_id`; the planet and star material families
share one stable bind/uniform contract while their visual logic is split into separate
shader sources.

## 2. Authoring Contract

Planets are authored as named JSON packages under `data/content/planets/` and placed by
the universe baseline. Genesis is the registry-package authoring surface; the
`planet.body` bundle remains the graph-record factory that emits validated ECS component
payloads.

The bundle emits:
- `display_name`
- `entity_labels`
- `owner_id`
- `size_m`
- `static_landmark`
- `map_icon`
- `sprite_shader_asset_id`
- `world_position`
- `world_rotation`
- `planet_body_shader_settings`

Planets intentionally do **not** emit collision components and do not use Avian transform
components unless they become real physics entities.

Static planet/celestial bodies that should participate in discovery must emit `static_landmark`.
The current `planet.body` bundle defaults the landmark kind from `body_kind` (`Planet`, `Star`,
or `BlackHole`), defaults `discoverable=true`, defaults `always_known=false`, and includes body
extent in discovery overlap unless `use_extent_for_discovery=false` is authored. Discovery
behavior and future notification/map plans are owned by
`docs/features/active/visibility_replication_contract.md`.

The active settings contract now separates:
- `body_kind`
  - `0 = planet`
  - `1 = star`
  - `2 = black_hole`
- `planet_type`
  - `0 = terran/oceanic`
  - `1 = desert`
  - `2 = lava/volcanic`
  - `3 = ice/frozen`
  - `4 = gas_giant`
  - `5 = moon/rocky`

That split is important: surface families stay planet-specific, while stars and black holes no longer masquerade as a fake `planet_type = 6` exotic bucket.

The settings contract also now exposes runtime art-direction controls for debugging and tuning:
- `sun_intensity`
- `enable_surface_detail`
- `enable_craters`
- `enable_clouds`
- `enable_atmosphere`
- `enable_specular`
- `enable_night_lights`
- `enable_emissive`
- `enable_ocean_specular`

Planet seeds remain authored and persisted as ordinary integer values, but the client hashes and normalizes that seed before feeding it into shader uniforms. Raw large integer seeds must not be used directly in per-pixel trig/noise expressions.

## 3. Rendering Contract

Planets render as layered procedural billboards on quads:

- the parent entity holds world position/rotation
- the client spawns a body child on `PLANET_BODY_RENDER_LAYER`
- optional cloud and ring/accretion children are attached as separate renderables
- the planet family is offset to a lower z plane than normal world sprites
- planets render behind ships using z/depth layering and a client-only projected visual offset, while the authoritative root remains centered on the true world position
- optional layer `screen_scale_factor` can enlarge or reduce apparent planet screen size independently of parallax motion

The gameplay camera renders both:
- default world layer `0`
- planet layer `2`

This allows planets to sit visually behind ships without moving them into the fullscreen backdrop path.

The layered planet order is now:
- ring back
- cloud back
- body
- cloud front
- ring front

That order is deliberate. It gives 2.5D occlusion cues without real 3D geometry:
- backside clouds can peek around the limb before disappearing behind the planet body
- ring systems can be partially occluded by the body instead of reading as one flat decal

## 4. Shader Model

`planet_visual.wgsl` is a 2D side-view globe shader family, not a 3D PBR mesh shader.

Current body shader behavior:
- reconstructs the visible hemisphere from the quad silhouette
- rotates the sphere around a planetary axis for sideways globe spin
- samples deterministic procedural terrain and color from spherical coordinates
- derives a perturbed normal from screen-space height derivatives for bump-style lighting
- applies water/specular response from terran surface masks instead of a generic whole-body gloss
- handles only the body, atmosphere, and emissive response
- uses domain-warped 3D fBm and cellular crater shaping instead of the earlier grid-prone animated 4D value-noise variant that was contributing visible lattice/banding artifacts and higher per-pixel hash pressure
- smooths the day/night terminator so atmosphere and direct light fall off more naturally near the limb

Current cloud shader behavior:
- renders clouds as dedicated back/front shell passes
- uses evolving weather-cell advection with a cheaper branched density path instead of evaluating every planet-family cloud model per fragment
- uses softer broad-cell and feathered wisp shaping instead of the previous scratchy line artifacts
- gates cloud coverage through density thresholds so cloud masses feel coherent instead of evenly noisy
- supports terran/oceanic and gas-giant cloud behavior separately
- keeps the cloud shell close to the body surface so authored cloud passes read as atmosphere-hugging weather rather than a detached outer sphere

Current ring shader behavior:
- renders black-hole accretion disks as dedicated back/front passes
- renders optional gas-giant hero rings as separate back/front passes
- keeps ring/accretion visuals out of the planet body shader

This split removes the old artifact-prone “everything in one shader” path that was contaminating the terran surface with cloud/ring-looking line work.

## 5. Lighting / Bump Support

Planets support bump-style lighting in the shader today by deriving a perturbed normal from the procedural height field.

This is not yet a separate generated normal-map texture path like the asteroid CPU generator. For planets, the bump response currently comes from the shader’s own height sampling. If we later need cached normal maps for expensive hero planets, that can be added without changing the Lua authoring contract.

Current lighting state:
- planet body, cloud, and ring passes now consume shared world-light uniforms derived from replicated `EnvironmentLightingState`
- when a `PlanetBodyShaderSettings` entity with `body_kind = 1` exists, direct light direction is resolved per rendered entity from that star's world position instead of one shard-global direction
- `EnvironmentLightingState.primary_direction_xy` and `primary_elevation` are now fallback direct-light values for worlds that do not currently expose a star body
- `sun_intensity` is still a per-planet art-direction multiplier over the shared primary light, not a replacement for shard/system lighting
- with `sun_intensity = 0`, the body no longer keeps an artificial minimum daylight floor
- any remaining visibility at zero sun must come from explicit emissive or atmosphere response, not a hardcoded lit baseline
- planets now also receive one bounded dominant nearby local-light contribution, currently sourced from client-derived plume emitters
- full multi-emitter accumulation is still pending, so this is intentionally a cheap 2.5D approximation rather than arbitrary local-light stacking

## 6. Visual Tuning Notes

The current terran pass now follows the right structural direction:
- ocean base
- landmass mask
- shallow-water transition
- polar-ice transition
- separate cloud pass

Recent tuning also borrowed useful ideas from `docs/sample-planet-shadertoy`:
- stronger distinction between deep water and shallow water
- cleaner coastline transitions
- layered atmosphere behavior instead of hard edge glow
- water-weighted specular highlights
- thresholded cloud density shaping
- planet-as-globe shading instead of top-down projection logic

We are not copying the Shadertoy literally, but it is now being used as a reference for globe readability and terrain layering.

We also reviewed `docs/4d_smooth_noise_algoritm` as a useful reference for gas-giant tuning. The active gas-giant path now borrows that idea directly for time-evolving smooth-noise band and storm flow so gas giants animate without obvious looping or axis-locked drift, while still using the authored primary/secondary/tertiary palette controls.

## 7. World Bootstrap

Current starter content places eight named planet/celestial bodies from the `maw`
universe baseline.

The starter sun lives at `(0, 0)` with `body_kind = 1`, and the client uses that entity as the current direct-light source for planets, asteroids, and thruster plumes.

Like the asteroid field, these are baseline-seeded records. A baseline manifest revision
change is picked up by the Ui scoped re-apply on replication restart; use
`siderealctl world-reset` for a clean full runtime-world reseed.

## 8. Next Work

1. Fold backdrop radiance and bounded local-light accumulation into the shared lighting contract so planets react to more than the current global environment terms.
2. Add a dedicated atmosphere shell pass for hero planets if we need richer scattering than the current in-body atmosphere response.
3. Tighten gas-giant cloud and body coupling so the body bands, cloud shell, and any hero rings feel like one coherent visual family.
4. Add more authored body presets in Lua and dashboard tooling now that `body_kind` and the layered passes are stable.
5. Add tactical-map planet icon styling once planet entities are common in the world.
