This guide defines the required workflow for creating new gameplay components.

## 1. File Location and Layout

- Define custom gameplay components in `crates/sidereal-game/src/components/`.
- Use one primary component per file.
- Keep tightly-coupled helper structs/enums in the same file when needed.
- Re-export through `crates/sidereal-game/src/components/mod.rs`.

## 2. Required Derives for Persistable Components

Persistable gameplay components must implement and register reflection + serde (normally by deriving):

```rust
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
#[reflect(Component, Serialize, Deserialize)]
```

2026-09-06 serialization requirement: replicated components must round-trip through
the actual bincode Serde codec as well as JSON persistence. Internally tagged enums
and conditionally omitted fields are unsuitable for bincode. Keep authored JSON
representations where required by using explicit human-readable/binary Serde
implementations, as `engine-render`'s `ZoneBoundary` does. Binary optional fields
must retain their position and encode their option discriminant. Cover absent and
present values, every enum variant and f64 precision. A binary layout change
requires a protocol version bump and matching native/WASM rebuilds.

## 3. `#[sidereal_component(...)]` Macro

Use the macro on new persistable/replicated gameplay components:

```rust
#[sidereal_component(
    kind = "inventory",
    persist = true,
    replicate = true,
    visibility = [OwnerOnly]
)]
```

Arguments:

- `kind`: Stable persisted/network component kind string.
- `persist`: Include in graph persistence/hydration.
- `replicate`: Include in network replication registration/policy.
- `visibility`: Allowed delivery scopes array.

The macro auto-registers the component for reflection and metadata discovery; do not manually edit
`register_generated_components` when adding a new custom component.

Visibility scopes:

- `OwnerOnly`
- `Faction`
- `Public`

If `visibility` is omitted, owner-only is the default policy.

## 4. Editor Schema Metadata

Persistable components now automatically participate in the generated editor-schema registry.

The runtime `GeneratedComponentRegistry` resource is the authoritative source for dashboard/editor
metadata. Each registry entry now carries:

- `component_kind`
- `type_path`
- `replication_visibility`
- `editor_schema`

`editor_schema` is inferred from Bevy reflection metadata after all component types are registered.
This is the contract dashboard/editor code should consume instead of hardcoding per-component UI
rules in frontend code.

Current inference behavior:

- primitive booleans -> `Bool`
- signed integers -> `SignedInteger`
- unsigned integers -> `UnsignedInteger`
- floats -> `Float`
- `String` -> `String`
- `Vec2` -> `Vec2`
- `Vec3` fields ending in `_rgb` -> `ColorRgb`
- `Vec4` fields ending in `_rgba` -> `ColorRgba`
- other `Vec3` / `Vec4` fields -> `Vec3` / `Vec4`
- enums -> `Enum` with variant option names
- lists/arrays/maps/sets -> `Sequence`
- structs/tuple structs are flattened into field paths like `foo.bar`

Default numeric hints are inferred conservatively:

- integers get `step = 1`
- floats get `step = 0.01`
- common shader-style fields such as `*_strength`, `*_opacity`, `*_scale`, `*_speed`,
  `*_intensity`, `*_density`, `*_alpha`, `*_power`, and similar get `min = 0`
- units are inferred from suffixes like `*_m`, `*_kg`, `*_mps`, `*_mps2`, `*_rad`

Important boundary:

- Rust owns the editor-schema inference/validation contract.
- Frontends should treat this metadata as authoritative for generic editors.
- Component-specific custom editors may still exist, but they are overrides, not the primary source
  of truth.
- When a component shape changes, the inferred schema updates automatically as long as reflection is
  kept correct.

Future extension point:

- explicit per-field override hints may be added later for cases where automatic inference is not
  enough
- that override path should live with the component definition or component registry metadata, not
  in dashboard-only maps

## 5. Examples

Simple component:

```rust
#[sidereal_component(kind = "cost", persist = true, replicate = true, visibility = [OwnerOnly, Public])]
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Default)]
#[reflect(Component, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Cost {
    pub credits: u64,
}
```

Nested/complex component:

```rust
#[derive(Reflect, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
#[reflect(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct InventoryEntry {
    pub item_entity_id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub quantity: u32,
    pub unit_mass_kg: f32,
}

#[sidereal_component(kind = "inventory", persist = true, replicate = true, visibility = [OwnerOnly])]
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Default)]
#[reflect(Component, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Inventory {
    pub entries: Vec<InventoryEntry>,
}
```

## 6. External/Runtime Components (Bevy/Avian)

Do not treat all Bevy/Avian components as durable gameplay schema by default.

- Runtime-only/transient physics internals remain non-persisted.
- Durable gameplay state should live in Sidereal gameplay components.
- For boundary translation cases (for example hierarchy rebuild or UUID lookup), keep explicit hydration logic at the runtime boundary.

## 7. Entity Archetype Layout (Bundles + Spawn Helpers)

For gameplay entities, keep archetype defaults and spawn helpers in `crates/sidereal-game/src/entities/`.

Current direction:

- one module per entity family (`ship`, `missiles`, `debris`, etc.),
- one module per archetype (`corvette`, `light_missile`, etc.),
- bundle + spawn helper in the same archetype file.

Example layout:

```text
crates/sidereal-game/src/entities/
  mod.rs
  ship/
    mod.rs
    corvette.rs
  missiles/
    mod.rs
    light_missile.rs
  debris/
    mod.rs
    small_debris.rs
```

Use this pattern for scalability. Do not spread one archetype's defaults across unrelated crates/services.

## 8. Bundle vs Spawn Function Rules

1. Use a `Bundle` for the base component set of a single entity.
2. Use `spawn_*` helpers when an archetype is a multi-entity graph (for example hull + hardpoints + modules).
3. Keep spawn-time overrides minimal and explicit (owner, shard, position, display name, etc.).
4. Prefer `*Overrides` structs over large ad-hoc config objects unless serialization/config IO requires otherwise.

Illustrative pattern:

```rust
#[derive(Bundle, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct MyEntityBundle {
    // base components
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default)]
pub struct MyEntityOverrides {
    pub position: Option<Vec3>,
    pub display_name: Option<String>,
}

pub fn spawn_my_entity(commands: &mut Commands, overrides: impl Into<MyEntityOverrides>) {
    let overrides = overrides.into();
    // spawn root bundle
    // spawn children/modules if needed
}
```

## 9. Bootstrap and Persistence Shape (Graph Records)

Bootstrap/persistence must use graph records as canonical shape (`GraphEntityRecord` + `GraphComponentRecord`).

Rules:

1. If an archetype needs bootstrap templates, keep a shared graph-template builder in shared crates (currently `engine-runtime-sync` templates are used by gateway/replication flows).
2. Gateway/direct bootstrap and replication bootstrap paths must produce equivalent full component-bearing graph records.
3. Avoid duplicate hand-maintained default loadouts in multiple services.

This keeps hydration deterministic and prevents drift between gateway and replication startup behavior.

## 10. Authoring Checklist for New Archetypes

When adding a new archetype (ship/missile/station/container/etc.):

1. Add bundle + spawn helper under `crates/sidereal-game/src/entities/`.
2. Add/verify persistable components in `crates/sidereal-game/src/components/` with `#[sidereal_component(...)]`.
3. Add or update graph-template bootstrap builder (if archetype participates in starter/bootstrap flows).
4. Ensure runtime asset references are logical `asset_id` values (not hardcoded disk paths).
5. Add tests for:
   - bundle/spawn default correctness,
   - persistence/hydration roundtrip,
   - replication visibility/policy constraints as applicable.

## Component snapshot replacement (2026-09-06)

Persisted component records are complete snapshots. The graph writer replaces
the component property map after its tick fence, including the canonical
component identity/kind/tick metadata. Do not merge property maps: a null-valued
optional field or a removed field must clear its previous stored value. This
is covered by `engine-persistence/tests/component_snapshot.rs` against AGE.
