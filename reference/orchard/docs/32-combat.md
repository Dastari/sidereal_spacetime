# 32 — Combat: Damage, Hostiles, and Danger Zones

Binding owner-directed spec (2026-08-26). Status: **training-target combat
foundation implemented 2026-08-27; hostile-combat phases not implemented**.
This is the combat-era doc that [25-stats-and-vitals.md](25-stats-and-vitals.md)
Phase 5 gated behind separate approval, and the "combat-era decision" that
[22-netcode.md](22-netcode.md) deferred. Builds on doc 25 (stats, vitals,
modifiers, knockout — all implemented), [26-underground-mines.md](26-underground-mines.md)
(the first hostile biome), [27-lighting-design.md](27-lighting-design.md)
(light as safety), [28-crafting.md](28-crafting.md) (weapons, plate gear,
arrows), [29-wildlife.md](29-wildlife.md) (peaceful fauna, untouched here),
[30-infinite-terrain.md](30-infinite-terrain.md) (chunk materialization and
stamps as the spawning machinery), and [31-npc-dialogue-and-commerce.md](31-npc-dialogue-and-commerce.md)
(talking NPCs are never combat targets). Enemy art is bounded by the licensed
paid packs (docs/18 §7).

[40](40-sanctuary-overworld-and-zoned-world.md) strengthens the danger-zone rule:
the target shared overworld is an authority-enforced sanctuary with no hostile
spawns, damaging combat, projectile hazards, or knockout from ordinary play. Combat
is valid only in a space profile explicitly declaring danger. The one sanctioned
surface exception is the non-hostile archery practice fixture in §3.1: it can receive
damage but cannot attack, die, drop rewards, damage scenery, or cause knockout.

[45](45-repeatable-loop-hunger-hunting-cooking.md) adds a later, narrow surface
exception: designated food animals may receive sword/bow damage, drop raw food,
and award Combat XP. It does not add hostile spawns, PvP, player damage, or
damage to protected wildlife and talking NPCs.

## 1. Principles (binding)

1. **Combat is opt-in danger, never ambient dread.** Hostiles exist only in
   **danger zones**: mine levels (doc 26), volcano islands (doc 30), and
   authored dungeon/ruin stamps. The surface overworld, farms, and the curated
   home island stay peaceful day and night. A "spooky nights" owner toggle is
   a listed later hook, off by default.
2. **No fail states.** Losing a fight is the doc 25 §11 knockout — wake at
   spawn, 25% health, `winded`, **never** item/currency/durability loss.
3. **No PvP.** Projectiles and swings never damage players other than their
   owner's target-of-one-species: hostiles. (The projectile sweep already
   detects players — that stays for knockback-free "thunk" feedback only.
   Consensual duels are a later hook.)
4. **Only food wildlife is targetable.** Cow, sheep, pig, chicken, rooster,
   duck, and goose are huntable under doc 45. Attacks pass through every other
   doc 29 species.
5. **The netcode split holds**: swing/draw animations and SFX predict
   client-side; every hit, health change, and death is an authoritative row
   change. Damage numbers are client particles derived from row deltas;
   hit-flash and invulnerability blink are cosmetics driven by status fields
   (docs/22 §6.1, verbatim).
6. **Authority stays at 20 Hz.** Swing intervals (350–500 ms), the existing
   swept projectile stepping, and cone melee all work at 50 ms ticks; nothing
   in this doc needs a rate increase. This resolves docs/22's deferred
   decision — recorded in DECISIONS.

## 2. The substrate (already implemented — do not rebuild)

Implementing agents start from: `resolveStats`/modifier pipeline and vitals in
centi-units; knockout + `winded`; `creatures.ts` statlines with
`resolveCreatureStats` and `world_npc.health` initialization; Vigour costs +
minimum swing intervals for `sword`/`bow` (doc 25 §4 table); `fireBow` +
`world_projectile` with cursor-landing entity hits, swept terrain collision, and hit-state rows;
player hitbox bounds; the deterministic `checks.ts` d20; `player_effect`
machinery. Combat v1 is mostly **wiring these together plus AI and content**.

## 3. Damage model — deterministic, stat-driven, integer

One pure module `packages/sim/src/combat.ts`. All values centi-units; no
stored RNG — variance and crits use the `checks.ts` stateless hash
(`worldSeed, attacker id, authorityTick, 'damage'`).

```
attackPower(melee)  = weaponBase × (str / 10)      // str scales melee
attackPower(ranged) = weaponBase × (dex / 10)      // dex scales ranged
variance            = 90%–110%   (hash-rolled, deterministic)
crit                = d20 roll ≥ 19 → ×150%        (checkBonus modifiers apply)
mitigation          = flat armor, then armorPct    (soften() softcap)
damage              = max(100, floor(attackPower × variance × crit) − armor)
```

- **New `StatTarget`s**: `attackPower`, `rangedPower`, `armor`, `armorPct` —
  slotting into the doc 25 pipeline unchanged. Plate gear (doc 28 anvil
  recipes) carries `armor` modifiers; jewelry carries offense/utility; every
  number is data in `balance.ts` + the docs/06 mirror.
- Weapon bases (display units): `sword 18`, `bow 14` (arrow required),
  starter improvised swings (`axe 8`, `pickaxe 6`, `shovel 6`, `hammer 12`)
  so a surprised miner can fight back badly — tools stay tools.
- Creature attacks run the same formula from their statlines. One math path,
  both directions — the doc 25 promise ("combat adds verbs, not state shape")
  kept literally.

### 3.1 Implemented training-target slice (2026-08-27)

`world_combat_target` is the first reusable damageable-entity projection. It is a
public, `spaceId` + chunk-indexed row with centi-health, maximum health, lazy
regeneration time, last-damaged time, and optional carrier identity. Three fixed
`archery_target` rows are reconciled at the north edge of the starter sand clearing.
They never reset after being moved and never enter an inventory: `useHands` lifts one
into the existing above-head carry state and places that same authoritative row.

Bow projectile landing tests the cursor-selected endpoint against the target's authored
bounds, re-fetches and revalidates the row at impact, resolves Dex-scaled and
authoritative-charge-scaled bow damage through `combat.ts`, writes only the
applied post-mitigation amount, and records `damage_dealt / archery_target`. Health is
clamped to one rather than destroying the fixture and regenerates at **1 displayed
health per second** with exact lazy catch-up. Embedded arrows remain attached for 30
seconds and may be recovered with E through a reducer that rechecks projectile state,
lifetime, space, reach, and inventory capacity. On timeout they use the existing
server-authorized recoverable-arrow ground path.

Clients derive floating damage text only from descending authoritative health rows;
the authority-confirmed last-hit critical bit makes crit text bold yellow. Embedded
projectiles sort immediately above their target so the recoverable arrow remains
legible, but retain their exact authoritative collision coordinates rather than snapping
to a target anchor. Carrying or placing a struck target translates each embedded arrow
by the same target delta, preserving its original impact offset. Selection uses the shared
entity-targeting path and existing target health frame.
The original ranged slice deliberately added no hostile AI, player/NPC damage, death,
drops, Combat XP, or sanctuary danger.

The follow-up training slice gives the iron sword its authored four-frame modular
player/tool swing. `attackCombatTarget` repeats the inventory, durability, Vigour,
minimum-swing, space, carry-state, and forward-contact-area checks on authority and
accepts only `archery_target` rows. It resolves Strength-scaled melee damage through
the shared combat formula and cannot damage resources, wildlife, NPCs, or players.

## 4. Melee and ranged verbs

- **Melee**: new reducer `attackMelee()` mirroring `harvestResource`'s shape —
  Vigour + swing-interval gates (already live for the sword), the standing
  facing-cone target pick restricted to **hostile NPCs**, then §3 damage to
  `world_npc.health`. Swing animation is the existing `AVATAR_ACTIONS`
  channel; no new netcode. Contact tools start with a one-tile-radius area
  centred one tile ahead of the character's facing. A future skill-tree range
  modifier expands that area; the unskilled base range stays at one tile.
- **Ranged**: `fireBow` gains consequences — consume 1 `arrow`, and on a
  `hit` row whose `hitKind` is a hostile NPC, apply §3 damage in the same
  tick. Every fired arrow becomes a recoverable `world_item` at its selected
  landing point or first collision. It remains planted for 30 seconds and uses
  the normal server-authorized nearby E pickup path; manually dropped arrows
  retain the ordinary ground-item lifetime. Bow draw-stages art
  (`Bow_Stages.png`) runs on the standing action channel.
  **Ranged charge amendment (2026-08-27, superseding the earlier fixed-range
  amendment):** draw time grows the resolved range budget from 16 px to 240 px
  over one second and its cost from 1 to 30 Vigour. The cursor selects any nearer
  destination inside that current budget. One shared parabola drives the client tracer, immediate
  prediction, confirmed projectile height, and tangent rotation; collision
  remains authoritative: terrain is swept along the ground-plane path, while an
  entity is hit only if the selected landing point lies inside its bounds. This
  keeps the cursor point as the embedded arrow's exact resting point. `beginBowCharge` records the
  server tick; release range and atomic Vigour spend use the lesser of elapsed
  authority time and client-requested time. The same verified duration scales
  final resolved bow damage from the one-Vigour tap fraction to 100% at full draw.
  The cursor-directed tracer always shows
  the full resolved aim path; its dots turn red from the bow outward to show the
  currently charged travel distance without moving the remaining guide. The client
  bar previews the same drain continuously but cannot fabricate charge. Future Combat
  skills/stats modify that shared maximum, and the tracer must display the resolved
  range rather than a separate client estimate.
- Hitting a hostile writes its `lastDamagedTick` (new column) — the status
  field that drives client hit-flash, exactly as docs/22 §6.1 reserved.

## 5. Hostile roster (art-verified, paid packs)

`CREATURE_DEFINITIONS` extends beyond `WildlifeSpecies` with hostile kinds:
`{ attributes, hostile: true, aggroRadiusTiles, leashRadiusTiles,
attackKind: 'melee' | 'ranged', attackBase, attackIntervalTicks, drops }`.

| Creature | Art | Zone | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slime (small/medium/big × 5 colors) | `Enemies/Slime/` | mines L1–2 | v1 melee starter enemy; size = statline tier, color follows the doc 30 variant-pool idea (cave-blue underground, red in volcano) |
| Skeleton / Skeleton Swordman | `Enemies/Skeleton/` | mines L2–3 | standard melee |
| Skeleton Bowman | `Skeleton_Bowman` (separated bow frames) | mines L3 | **reuses `world_projectile`** — enemy arrows are the same rows, owner = NPC id band |
| Bombschroom | `Bombschroom` + gas VFX | mines L2–3 | fuse-then-burst AoE (gas cloud = `world_projectile` variant with radius); telegraphed by its animation |
| Mummy, Desert Warriors (atgier/bow) | Desert pack | desert ruin stamps | phase 4 |
| Cowling, Cowling Mage, Flying Skull | Volcano pack | volcano islands | phase 4; mage projectile art ships in the main pack |
| Goblins / Orcs (Characters pack) | camps via stamps | later hook | with structure generation |

Skeleton Mage and spellcasting hostiles wait for the mana/spell era. All
hostiles are `world_npc` rows in the wildlife id conventions, chunk-scoped,
stepped only near players.

## 6. AI — the hash FSM grows three states

Extending the deterministic stateless-hash pattern of `npc.ts` (no stored RNG,
replayable): `idle/wander` (exists) → **`aggro`** → **`attack`** → **`return`**.

- **Aggro**: nearest player in the same space within `aggroRadiusTiles`,
  checked on the creature's existing decision cadence. **Light is safety**
  (docs 26/27 made tactical): in fixed-ambient spaces (mines), a player
  standing in light (own torch/lantern or a static emitter — the server
  re-derives generated-lantern pools from the same pure generation) is seen at
  full radius; in darkness beyond any light, detection drops to half.
  Skulking past skeletons in the dark with your torch stowed is the intended
  risk/reward inversion of "hold light or swing" (doc 26 §6).
- **Attack**: melee closes to adjacent and swings on its interval; ranged
  kites at 4–6 tiles and fires. Creature swings use the same action-channel
  animation model as players.
- **Return/leash**: beyond `leashRadiusTiles` from home, drop aggro, path
  home, regenerate to full — no gate-dragging exploits, no infinite chases.
- Caps: at most `MAX_ENGAGED_PER_PLAYER = 3` creatures aggro one player;
  extras hold at wander. Cozy pressure, not a zerg.

## 7. Spawning — the doc 30 machinery, danger-zone gated

Hostile spawn tables key on `(spaceId, biome/level, stamp flags)`: mine-level
tables (doc 26 §4 rooms get spawn weight; entry halls stay safe), volcano
island surfaces, and stamp-authored dungeon rooms. Population happens at chunk
materialization plus the lazy repopulation sweep, with per-neighborhood caps —
identical machinery to wildlife, different table. Danger zones repopulate
slowly (hours, not minutes): clearing a gallery buys a mining session, not
permanence. Hostiles never spawn within sight of portals/spawn points, in
curated peaceful chunks, or in any non-danger zone, structurally.

## 8. Taking damage — players

- Creature hits apply §3 damage to `player_stats.healthCenti` through the
  doc 25 lazy pipeline; at 0 the **implemented knockout** path fires. A new
  `lastDamagedTick` on the public vitals surface drives hit-flash + a 1 s
  post-hit invulnerability window (authority-checked, cosmetically blinked).
- **Remote health**: doc 25's reserved `player_vitals_public { identity,
  healthPct: u8 }` lands here (additive) so allies see each other's state in
  a fight; hostile NPC health is already public on `world_npc`.
- Health regen pauses for 5 s after taking damage (out-of-combat regen — one
  new modifier-pipeline environment rule), so fights have stakes without
  potion-chugging pressure.

## 9. Death, drops, and feedback

- At 0 health a hostile dies: puff/bone burst particles (Break-anim style),
  a `died` state row retained ~1 s for client playback, then deletion.
- **Drops** (world_item rows, shared pickup rules): slimes → `slime_gel`
  (new material item; icon from the pack icon sheets, art-verify at
  extraction), skeletons → `bone` (`Desert_Bones.png` / icon sheets) + ~30%
  arrow (bowman), bombschroom → mushroom dressing items (doc 26 cave
  decor). `slime_gel`/`bone` become crafting inputs (torch-slow-fall? glue?
  — recipes authored in the docs/28 §6 table when these land; docs/06
  mirror). Rare gem-chunk drops in deep-mine kinds tie the loop to smelting.
- **Feedback per docs/13/22**: floating damage numbers (small pixel text
  particles, client-derived), hit-flash tint, no screen shake, no blood —
  bone-puffs and slime-splats only. SFX set (swing-hit, arrow-thunk, slime
  squish, skeleton rattle, knockout sting) via the `game-music` skill.
- XP does not exist and combat grants none — progression stays gear, materials,
  and the docs/06 economy. (Skill trees may later hook kills as Knowledge
  events; not v1.)

## 10. Phasing

0. **Training foundation (implemented 2026-08-27)**: deterministic `combat.ts`,
   combat modifier targets, indexed damageable target rows, authoritative bow damage,
   selection/health frame, floating damage text, lazy regeneration, carried practice
   targets, and embedded arrows.
1. **Damage core (hostile remainder)**: arrows damage hostiles,
   `attackMelee`, NPC death/drops/`lastDamagedTick`, hit feedback — proven
   against a spawned test slime behind an owner debug reducer.
2. **Mines go live**: slime + skeleton rosters, AI FSM with light-based
   detection, danger-zone spawn tables + repopulation, engaged-cap.
3. **Players bleed**: creature attack path, invulnerability window, regen
   pause, `player_vitals_public`, knockout wiring end-to-end, two-client
   verification.
4. **Ranged + exotic**: skeleton bowman (NPC projectiles), bombschroom AoE,
   volcano + desert rosters with their stamps.
5. **Later hooks**: skill/stat modifiers for bow range; hunting decision; spellcasting +
   mages (mana's first spender); boss stamps; goblin/orc camps; duels;
   "spooky nights" surface toggle; combat skill-tree branch.

## 11. Out of scope

PvP; wildlife damage; durability; XP/levels; spells and mana spending;
knockback physics; status ailments beyond existing effects (poison etc. come
with their sources); mounted combat (attacks stay dismounted per the standing
riding gates); difficulty settings.

## 12. Tests and acceptance

- **Unit (sim)**: damage-formula goldens named `32§3` (variance bounds, crit
  application, armor softcap, minimum-damage floor, determinism: same seed
  parts → same roll); FSM transition goldens on fixture layouts (aggro radius
  ±light, leash return, engaged-cap election, ranged kiting distance); drop
  table distributions; spawn-table zone gating (a peaceful chunk can never
  roll a hostile).
- **Reducer (world)**: `attackMelee` happy/`out_of_range`/wrong-target
  (player, wildlife, dialogue NPC)/Vigour-and-interval-gated/auth-failure;
  arrow damage + ammo consumption + recovery item; NPC death transaction
  (health 0 → drops + died-state → cleanup); player damage → knockout
  end-to-end; invulnerability window rejects double-hits.
- **Two-client**: A fights a skeleton, B sees identical health bars, flashes,
  death, and drops; B's presence pulls a second creature only up to the cap;
  A knocked out wakes at spawn with `winded` while B loots the gallery.
- **Browser**: full mine fight at UI scales 1–3 — readable in near-darkness
  with one torch; damage numbers legible, no overdraw regressions; danger
  zones honored (walk the surface at night untouched).

The implemented foundation subset additionally requires three spaced targets at the
starter sand clearing; server-owned lift/place without inventory rows; click selection
with a shared health frame; deterministic damage + visible row-derived floating text;
slow regeneration; and arrows visibly embedded for 30 seconds. Focused sim, authority
source-contract, regional-subscription, and entity-selection tests cover that slice.

## 13. Bookkeeping

- **docs/06**: combat tuning section (weapon bases, creature statlines,
  drop tables, spawn densities). **docs/00**: doc-map row. **docs/14**:
  milestone entries.
- **docs/22**: §9's deferred authority-rate note resolved — annotate.
  **docs/25**: Phase 5 pointer here. **docs/26**: mines' "combat era" hooks
  now specified. **docs/29**: wildlife untargetable cross-note.
- **DECISIONS.md** on adoption: (1) combat is danger-zone-opt-in, hostiles
  only, no PvP, wildlife untargetable in v1; (2) authority stays 20 Hz for
  the combat era (resolves docs/22 deferral); (3) damage is deterministic
  stat-driven with stateless-hash variance/crits — no stored RNG; (4) light
  level halves hostile detection in dark spaces (light is safety).
