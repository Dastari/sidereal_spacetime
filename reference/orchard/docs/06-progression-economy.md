# 06 — Progression & Economy: The Numbers

The single source of truth for tuning. Implementation mirror: every constant here
lives in `packages/sim/src/balance.ts`, and every table gets a golden-number Vitest
test named for its section (see [15-agent-workflow.md](15-agent-workflow.md) §4).
Numbers were rebalanced from the incremental (which peaked at 1e25) to an avatar
scale peaking ~1e9. The redesign PDF's P0s are all implemented here: Pomace capital,
Knowledge gates, charged Vigour, rule-changing Cultivars + Lineage baseline.

## 1. Currencies

| Currency  | Kind                              | Earned                          | Spent                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Fruit     | run                               | trees, tends, forage            | saplings, plot clearing, grove upgrades   |
| Pomace    | run                               | 15% of fruit pressed            | presses, press upgrades; OR compost mulch |
| Must      | run                               | pressing (yield 0.5/fruit base) | casks, cellar upgrades; aged into bottles |
| Bottles   | run                               | aging × bottleValue (base 0.1)  | cellar digs; scored at Vintage            |
| Terroir   | persistent (resets at Succession) | Vintage ceremony                | skill tree ranks                          |
| Knowledge | persistent score, never spent     | play milestones (§5)            | gates skill tiers                         |
| Heirlooms | persistent (resets at Lineage)    | Succession                      | not spent; +25% each (+40% w/ cultivar)   |
| Seeds     | permanent                         | Lineage                         | Cultivars                                 |

All currency values are integers in sim state (fruit in whole units; rates accrue in
a fixed-point fractional accumulator). Nothing exceeds 2^53.

## 2. Production tables

### Trees (per mature tree, Care ×1.0, no modifiers)

| #   | Species         | Sapling cost (fruit) | Fruit/s | Trait value          |
| --- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| 1   | Seedling Apple  | 15                   | 0.10    | —                    |
| 2   | Orchard Apple   | 120                  | 0.60    | lifts 1.5%/5         |
| 3   | Pear            | 900                  | 3.2     | Autumn ×1.8          |
| 4   | Quince          | 6,500                | 15      | feeds press +2%/5    |
| 5   | Plum            | 48,000               | 70      | lifts 1.2%/5         |
| 6   | Fig             | 360,000              | 330     | Summer ×1.8          |
| 7   | Cherry          | 2.8M                 | 1,600   | Summer ×1.8          |
| 8   | Heritage Grafts | 22M                  | 7,500   | lifts 2%/5           |
| 9   | Frost Medlar    | 170M                 | 36,000  | Winter ×1.8          |
| 10  | Vale Medlar     | 1.3B                 | 170,000 | feeds cellar +2.5%/5 |

- Sapling cost grows **×1.18 per tree of that species already planted**.
- `lifts`: adds its % to every _other_ species per 5 planted; monocultures gain nothing.
- `feeds`: adds % to press/cellar _capacity_ per 5 planted; total fed bonus per stage
  capped at **+50%**.
- Global synergy (skill-gated): +0.15%–0.4% all fruit per tree planted.
- Per-species milestones at 5/10/15 planted: that species ×2 each; at **25**: ×3
  (endgame target, not a per-Vintage expectation — PDF §7).
- Care multiplies ×1.0–×2.0 ([04](04-orchard-design.md) §3). Spring features the
  whole Grove at ×1.6 (+ skill). A species whose table trait names the current
  season uses its more-specific ×1.8 value; other stage/species combinations run
  off-season at ×0.85. The two featured bonuses never stack.

### Presses (first Basket Press: repaired for 50 fruit, one time; all others cost Pomace)

| Tier | Name            | Cost (pomace) | Processes fruit/s | Pads |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---- |
| 1    | Basket Press    | 25            | 0.5               | 1    |
| 2    | Screw Press     | 180           | 3                 | 1    |
| 3    | Hydraulic Press | 1,400         | 18                | 1    |
| 4    | Belt Line       | 12,000        | 120               | 1    |
| 5    | Pressing Works  | 100,000       | 900               | 2    |

Cost ×1.35 per press of same tier owned. Yield: 1 fruit → **0.5 must** (upgrades +
skills to ~1.0). Pomace: **15%** of fruit pressed. Per-tier milestones at 3/6/10
owned: ×2/×2/×3 that tier.

### Casks (cost Must)

| Tier | Name             | Cost (must) | Ages must/s |
| ---- | ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1    | Demijohn shelf   | 80          | 0.2         |
| 2    | Oak Barrels      | 300         | 1.2         |
| 3    | Foudre           | 2,400       | 7           |
| 4    | Stone Vault      | 20,000      | 40          |
| 5    | Cellar Cathedral | 170,000     | 240         |

Cost ×1.35 per same tier. Bottles = must aged × **bottleValue 0.1** (upgrades/skills
to ~0.4). Milestones as presses. Cellar digs: level 2 = 500 bottles, level 3 =
25,000 bottles (bottle sink — spend vs. score).

### Farmhouse upgrade counter, capacity, and compost upgrades

The original draft referenced this table from 04 without including it. Costs keep
each stage funded by its own capital and follow the documented ×6–8 tier spacing.

| Upgrade               | Currency |        Cost | Rule                                              |
| --------------------- | -------: | ----------: | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Pruning Shears        |    Fruit |          75 | Care decay interval 2 → 3 days                    |
| Tall Ladders          |    Fruit |         450 | Harvest interaction radius 2 → 4 tiles            |
| Irrigation            |    Fruit |       3,000 | Halves the off-season penalty                     |
| Bee Boost             |    Fruit |      20,000 | Blossom-adjacent trees +10% fruit                 |
| Cart & Mule           |    Fruit |     140,000 | Automatically hauls harvested Fruit to the hopper |
| Copper Pipe           |   Pomace |          75 | Routes yard Must directly to the cellar bank      |
| Yard Expansion I / II |   Pomace | 500 / 4,000 | Press pads 5 → 8 → 12                             |
| Cork Bench            |     Must |         250 | bottleValue 0.10 → 0.15                           |
| Blending Bench        |     Must |       1,800 | bottleValue → 0.25                                |
| Cellar Book           |     Must |      13,000 | bottleValue → 0.40                                |

The press-yard jug rack has a base capacity of **100 Must**. Without Copper Pipe,
presses stop at that cap until the player hauls jugs away; the pipe bypasses it.
Compost mulch costs **5 Pomace per tree** and holds Care decay for three days.
Plot clearing is permanent spatial progress: 15 plots initially, then 30 / 60 /
90 / 120 plots for 2,000 / 16,000 / 130,000 / 1,000,000 Fruit.

### Live Homestead gold upgrades

The shared-world Homestead loop uses permanent gold ladders separate from the retired
fruit/pomace counters above. Costs are whole gold (10,000 bronze each).

| Upgrade | Rank costs | Effect per rank |
|---|---:|---|
| Rich Soil | 2 / 6 / 18 gold | +10% watered crop growth speed |
| Selective Seeds | 3 / 9 / 27 gold | +10% deterministic average harvest yield |
| Barrel Cellar | 4 / 12 / 36 gold | +8 batch capacity; +10% curing speed |
| Estate Vintage | 6 / 18 / 54 gold | 45 / 60 / 90 min aging; 2× / 4× / 8× Bottle value |
| Sprinkler | 5 gold each | radius-2 continuous watering; requires Sprinkler Engineering |

## 3. Vigour & tending

- Charge rate: `0.04/s × (1 + vigourRate skills)`; ×4 in Autumn; +25% for 2 h after
  sleeping. Full charge base **25 s**.
- Payout at full charge: `15 s of current grove fruit/s × burstPower`,
  `burstPower = 2 + 0.6/rank (Burst skill, max 5.6)`. Partial payouts per the
  curve in [04](04-orchard-design.md) §4. Post-burst the meter retains
  `vigourKeep` (0 base, softened cap 0.8 via Momentum skill).
- `tendFromRate` skills add +2–3% of grove rate to _every_ tend (keeps tending
  relevant at scale). Autumn chain: ×1.1/link, cap ×2.

## 4. Prestige formulas

| Layer          | Formula                                                                          | First trigger pace               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Vintage**    | `terroir = floor((bottles/100)^0.45 × 6 × (1+terroirGain))`, minimum 100 bottles | Year 1 ≈ 250 bottles → 9 Terroir |
| **Succession** | `heirlooms = floor((terroirEver/500)^0.5) − heirloomsHeld`                       | ~vintage 4–6                     |
| **Lineage**    | `seeds = floor((heirloomsEver/20)^0.5) − seedsClaimed`                           | after ~3–4 successions           |

- Doubling a Vintage's Terroir needs ~4.7× the bottles (0.45 exponent, kept from the
  original — it worked).
- Each Heirloom: ×1.25 all production (×1.40 with Long Lineage cultivar).
- **Lineage baseline (PDF P0): ×1.5 all production per completed Lineage, permanent,
  independent of Seeds.** Terroir Memory cultivar keeps 25% of Terroir + one chosen
  skill branch through Succession (PDF-boosted version).
- Vintage carries/resets: see [05](05-cellar-design.md) §3. `keepTree` fraction cap
  0.65; `keepBottles` cap 0.5; `startTrees` up to 30 free seedlings.

## 5. Knowledge (PDF P0 — the skill tree gate)

Knowledge is per-branch (Grove/Press/Cellar/Estate), earned only by playing:

| Source                                                                                          | Knowledge                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| First-time events (first press run, first bottle, first festival, each species' first harvest…) | +1 to the matching branch |
| Almanac entries (species mastered, forageables found)                                           | +1                        |
| Per-species/tier milestones (5/10/15/25)                                                        | +1 branch                 |
| Each Vintage completed                                                                          | +1 to every branch        |
| Festival participation                                                                          | +1 seasonal branch        |

**Tier gates** (both conditions required):

| Skill tier | Needs                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1          | open immediately                       |
| 2          | branch Knowledge ≥ 3                   |
| 3          | branch Knowledge ≥ 7 AND Vintages ≥ 3  |
| 4          | branch Knowledge ≥ 12 AND Vintages ≥ 7 |
| Capstones  | ≥ 1 Succession                         |

Buy All exists but only within unlocked tiers (PDF). A rich early Vintage can never
skip experiential progression — this is the fix for the 472-ranks-in-one-burst
pathology.

## 6. Skill tree (Estate Book) — 40 nodes, 4 branches

Rank cost `ceil(base × 2.5^rank)`; first ranks across the whole tree total ≈ 160
Terroir; a full tree ≈ 220k lifetime Terroir (reached over many Successions — the
gates, not the prices, do the pacing). Respec refunds 80%.

Branch skeleton (9 nodes each, tiers 1–4, + 4 cross capstones). Effects reuse the
original's vocabulary; per-node bases in `balance.ts` follow the cost ladder
1/2/2/6/7/13/32/82/202 within each branch, capstones 70/70/167/659:

- **Grove:** Mulching (treeMult), Deep Roots (offlineRate), Pollinators (treeMult),
  Windbreak (seasonSoften), Understorey (cheapSaplings), Seed Bank (startTrees),
  Coppice (treeSynergy), Living Hedge (seasonBoost), **The Great Tree** (treeMult ×4 big rank).
- **Press:** Sharp Blades (pressMult), Rhythm (vigourRate), Second Pressing
  (pressYield), Windfalls (tendFromRate), Burst (vigourPower), Nothing Wasted
  (pressYield+pomace +3%), Momentum (vigourKeep), Cold Pressing (pressMult),
  **The Great Press**.
- **Cellar:** Airlocks (cellarMult), Wild Yeast (bottleValue), Racking (cellarMult),
  Cellar Book (offlineCap +1.5 h/rank), Reserve Stock (keepBottles), Solera
  (cellarMult), Vintage Chart (bottleValue), Cork Library (offlineRate),
  **The Great Vintage** (bottleValue).
- **Estate:** Farmhand (allMult), Ledger (terroirGain), **The Picker** (estate hand:
  auto-harvest, 1 rank), Almanac Study (knowledge from events +1), **The Press Hand**
  (auto-haul + press feeding, 1 rank), Night Watch (offlineRate), Rootstock
  (keepTree), **The Cellar Master** (auto-racking, 1 rank), **The Whole Estate** (allMult).
- **Capstones:** Windfall Cider (tree+press), Estate Bottling (cellar+all), Perry
  Works (tree+cellar), **The Long View** (allMult + terroirGain; needs 1 rank in all
  branch-9 nodes).

## 7. Cultivars (Seeds; PDF-proposed effects; total 31 Seeds)

| Cost | Cultivar        | Rule change                                                                   |
| ---- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Windfall Stock  | Pressed fruit also credits 25% of its value as spendable Fruit                |
| 1    | Cold Cellar     | Entire estate runs at 100% efficiency offline; cellar ignores the offline cap |
| 2    | Perennial Roots | Keep 40% of trees AND one grove milestone tier through Vintage                |
| 2    | Deep Taproot    | Unlimited offline duration; efficiency fades to 40% after 24 h                |
| 3    | Even Year       | No off-season penalty; non-featured stages get +15%                           |
| 3    | Grafted Stock   | Saplings cost 30% less                                                        |
| 4    | Terroir Memory  | Keep 25% Terroir + one chosen skill branch through Succession                 |
| 4    | Cellar Overflow | Overflow must self-ages at 30% of total cask rate                             |
| 5    | Hands Free      | Apprentice NPC auto-cashes full-charge Vigour tends                           |
| 6    | Long Lineage    | Heirlooms worth +40% instead of +25%                                          |

## 8. Offline progress

`applyOffline(state, elapsed)`: cap = 8 h base + Cellar Book/Standing-order skills
(+12 h Taproot → unlimited w/ decay). Efficiency 60% base, softened toward 100%
via skills (`soften(cap, base, sum) = cap − (cap−base)·e^(−sum/(cap−base))` — kept
verbatim from the original). Simulate 60 coarse chunks through the real economy step
so offline obeys the same bottlenecks as live play. Estate hands keep working
offline; Care decays at half rate offline (kindness rule).

Public ground-item drops persist for **20 real minutes / 24,000 authority ticks**
before the authority removes them. Picking an item up removes it immediately.

## 9. Achievements (curated 40)

Keep the original's structure — each grants a permanent global bonus; total ≈
**+150%**. Categories: tending (3), stockpiles (4), production rates (4), planting
(4), species collection (3), press/cellar counts (4), vintages 1/5/25/100 (4),
skill ranks (2), successions (3), lineages/cultivars (4), festivals (2), social —
first visit hosted, 10 guestbook signatures (2), completionist — every upgrade at
once (1, the hardest, per the original's design). Full roster with bonuses is an
appendix table in `balance.ts` — implementer fills values proportionally (1–8%
each) with a golden test asserting the +150% total.

## 10. Pacing targets (tune to these, not vice versa)

| Milestone                           | Target play time                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| First press running                 | 15–25 min                          |
| First must → first bottle           | 45–70 min                          |
| First Vintage                       | 5–7 h (late in game-year 1)        |
| Second Vintage                      | ~4 h (faster: skills + startTrees) |
| First Succession                    | 25–35 h                            |
| First Lineage                       | 80–120 h                           |
| All cultivars (31 Seeds)            | aspirational, 500 h+               |
| "Every upgrade at once" achievement | final-run project                  |

Anti-frustration invariants: no fail states; nothing ever decreases below a floor
except by prestige choice; every session ≥15 min must include at least one visible
step forward (a milestone, unlock, or new almanac entry) through year 3 — verify in
playtesting.

## 11. Stats, vitals, and effects

The live overworld character system is specified in
[25-stats-and-vitals.md](25-stats-and-vitals.md). These are the binding balance
numbers; §3 above remains the retired solo farm scene's tend-charge economy.

- Six base attributes—STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA—start at **10**, store in the
  **1–30** range, and use `floor((attribute - 10) / 2)` for checks. Health derives
  from STR, Mana from INT, and Vigour from CON.
- Vitals use centi-units (**100 centi = 1 displayed unit**). Max Health is
  `10 × STR`, max Mana `10 × INT`, and max Vigour `10 × CON`; all baseline at
  **100 displayed / 10,000 centi**.
- Health regenerates **0.2/s** flat. Mana regenerates **0.1 × WIS/s** (1.0/s at
  baseline). Vigour regenerates **1.2 × CON/s** (12.0/s at baseline; empty to full
  in about 8.3 seconds). Lazy online sweeps run every **10 authority ticks / 0.5
  seconds**; offline catch-up is allowed.
- Modifier percentages use basis points (**10,000 = 100%**) and resolve in the
  sole order flat → summed additive percent → stable-id multiplicative percent →
  highest override → bounds/softcap. Attributes hard-cap at 30; regen uses the
  shared softcap path.
- Hold Shift while moving on foot to Sprint at **125% speed**. Baseline drain is
  **10 Vigour/s** and regeneration pauses while Sprint is active, including
  queued sprint steps awaiting authority processing. The pre-modifier
  drain is `10 × 10 / CON` (rounded upward in centi-units); `sprintSpeed` and
  `sprintVigourCost` accept equipment, effect/buff/debuff, skill, and environment
  modifiers. Insufficient Vigour degrades the next step to ordinary walking.

| Tool         |        Vigour cost | Minimum interval at 20 Hz |
| ------------ | -----------------: | ------------------------: |
| Watering can |                  8 |          6 ticks / 300 ms |
| Hoe          |                  5 |          6 ticks / 300 ms |
| Fishing rod  |                  6 |          6 ticks / 300 ms |
| Bow          | 1–30 (draw-scaled) |          6 ticks / 300 ms |
| Sword        |                 12 |          7 ticks / 350 ms |
| Axe          |                 50 |          8 ticks / 400 ms |
| Pickaxe      |                 50 |         10 ticks / 500 ms |
| Shovel       |                 12 |          7 ticks / 350 ms |
| Hammer       |                 18 |          9 ticks / 450 ms |

A whiff costs half Vigour, rounded up. Initial effects are **Well Rested** (+25%
Vigour regen, 2 hours / 144,000 ticks), **Winded** (−50% Vigour regen, 90 seconds /
1,800 ticks), and **Orchard Tea** (+2 CON, 5 minutes / 6,000 ticks). Skill-check
DCs are trivial **5**, easy **10**, medium **15**, and hard **20**. At zero Health,
the character is knocked out: respawn at their spawn slot with **25% Health** and
Winded, with no item, currency, or durability loss.
New-character allocation searches walkable tiles in rings across the established
spawn area, up to **60 tiles** from its centre; this is a spatial safety bound, not
a concurrent-player slot cap.

### Combat training constants

The implemented doc 32 training slice uses a **14 displayed damage** bow base,
Dexterity scaling (`base × DEX / 10`), deterministic **90–110%** variance, a d20
critical on **19–20** for **150%**, flat armor before percentage armor, and a minimum
of **1 displayed damage**. Archery targets have **100 displayed Health**, never fall
below 1, and regenerate **1 Health per second** with lazy offline/unoccupied catch-up.
Critical floating damage is bold yellow; ordinary damage retains the light neutral
combat-text color.
Bow draw time simultaneously sets its tracer/range budget and Vigour cost: a tap has
a **1 Vigour** floor, and a **1,000 ms** full draw reaches **240 px** and costs **30
Vigour**. The local bar drains continuously while drawing, capped by available Vigour;
the authority timestamps draw start and atomically charges the same duration at
release, treating the client duration only as a range-reducing upper bound. The full
cursor-directed tracer remains visible up to the bow's resolved maximum while its
reachable dots fill red to communicate the current charge distance.
Arrows remain embedded in a target for **30 seconds**, can be recovered with E during
that interval, then become an ordinary server-authorized recoverable arrow.

Successful uses cost one tool durability; rejected actions and whiffs cost none.
Maximums and full-repair costs are: Axe **200 / 1 Wood**, Pickaxe **250 / 1 Stone**,
Hoe **180 / 1 Wood**, Watering can **160 / 1 Stone**, Bow **300 / 1 Wood**,
Shovel **220 / 1 Stone**, Hammer **300 / 1 Stone**, Fishing rod **160 / 1 Wood**,
and Sword **250 / 1 Stone**. At zero, a tool is broken
but retained. `R` repairs the selected damaged tool. Slot bars are green above 50%,
gold at 21–50%, and red at 20% or below.

## 12. Crafting foundations, materials, and workbench tier

Wild grass tilled with a hoe has a deterministic hash-gated **30%** chance to
drop **1 Fiber** in addition to creating soil. A crafting station is in reach
when it is in the player's current space and no more than **2 tiles** away.

### New item commerce values

Every listed value is bronze per item. A dash means the merchant buys the item
from players but does not normally stock it.

| Item           | Buy | Sell |
| -------------- | --: | ---: |
| Fiber          |   — |    2 |
| Workbench      | 120 |   48 |
| Campfire       |   — |   18 |
| Fence          |   — |    4 |
| Fence Gate     |   — |   12 |
| Sign           |   — |   10 |
| Standing Torch |   — |   20 |

## 13. Legacy-island stepped terrain

The live island raises its four organic plateau masks into at most **3 logical
elevation levels**. Each successive contour is inset **4 tiles** from the level
below; an eroded connected summit smaller than **24 tiles** is discarded. These
numbers change the mountain silhouette only. The autotiler, semantic crossing
rules, projected face height, and collision thickness remain independent contracts.

## 14. Procedural sanctuary generation

The doc 43 sanctuary initially materializes a **12-chunk radius** around its selected
spawn origin: **25×25 chunks / 400×400 tiles**. This covers the client maximum
nine-chunk view radius plus a three-chunk preparation buffer. The generator does not
force that region to be an island; seed preview selects a suitable central land area.

Chunks outside that initial square materialize only when player-interest look-ahead
approaches them. The playable signed extent is initially **−32,000 through +32,000
tiles per axis**. These are operational generation limits, not authored map edges.

Generator v4 minor rivers retain a **3–4-tile semantic water width** through diagonal
bends. This leaves a readable water core after bank art is composed and prevents
single-cell or bank-only pinch points; major rivers, lakes, and oceans remain separate
hydrology scales.

Generator v5 converts a river crossing a **south-facing elevation drop** into a
**4-row waterfall strip**: rim, upper face, lower face, and ground-contact/pool row.
V5 preserves V4's terrain fields and river width. Side- and north-facing crossings
remain subject to the contour-validity/rerouting pass because the current waterfall
family is authored for the visible south face only.

Generator v6 repairs a representable south-facing crossing into a **3-tile-wide,
4-row vertical waterfall**. The upstream and downstream river each receive a
minimum **3-row approach**, extended deterministically up to **16 rows** when the
seeded centreline moves too far laterally for cardinally connected water. The crest
is flattened across the three water tiles plus a **2-tile land shoulder per bank**;
its first row retains the upper elevation and the remaining three rows use the lower
elevation. V6 preserves V5's macro terrain fields, river centrelines, and ordinary
river width.

## 15. Live character progression

The live overworld supersedes §§5–6's retired solo-scene Knowledge/Terroir tree with
the three-track system in [36](36-character-progression.md). Combat, Explorer, and
Farming each use independent server-owned XP and points. Total XP required for level
`n` is `floor(100 × n^1.7)`, level is derived rather than stored, the v1 cap is
**50**, and every level grants one point spendable only in that track. Owner debug
grants are bonus points, never XP.

The initial review roster has **14 nodes per tree including its always-owned root**.
Explorer covers running speed/efficiency, path travel, small-gap and mounted jumping,
night vision, cave discovery, exploration XP, mapping, and carried space. Combat
covers arrow/sword damage, draw speed, criticals, recovery, Vigour efficiency,
shields, Health, piercing, multishot, and weapon capstones. Farming covers yield,
watering, seed recovery, crop bundles, soil information, grafting, preserving,
beekeeping, sprinklers, greenhouses, seasonal resilience, and a harvest capstone.
Names, graph positions, rank caps, level gates, and descriptions are canonical in
`packages/sim/src/skill-trees.ts`.

Per-track reset costs in bronze are **0, 100, 500, 2,500, then 10,000** for all
later resets. Resetting refunds the spent points by removing that character's ranks;
XP and developer bonus points remain. In the 2026-08-28 review slice, purchases and
resets persist but every advertised skill effect remains deliberately inactive.

## 16. Early metal refinement

Loose stones and breakable rocks yield pebbles; a full 3×3 crafting grid of nine
pebbles produces one stone. Iron, copper, and gold veins yield small metal pieces;
nine matching pieces produce one ore chunk. Gem ores remain raw gems and are not
smelted.

A workbench crafts one furnace from an eight-stone ring. Its three authority-owned
slots are ore, fuel, and output. One wood or one plank fuels one bar, sticks are not
fuel, and one bar takes **5 real minutes** with offline catch-up. Sale values are:

| Material | Piece | Ore chunk | Bar |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Copper | 7 | 63 | 130 |
| Iron | 10 | 90 | 184 |
| Gold | 36 | 324 | 652 |

Each bar is exactly twice the ore-chunk value plus one wood fuel's 2-bronze sell
opportunity cost. The crop barrel is a workbench recipe of **6 planks + 2 iron
bars**, making crop processing a deliberate post-smelting progression step.
