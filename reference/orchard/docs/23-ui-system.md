# 23 — UI System: Widgets, Windows, and Containers

Binding owner-directed spec (2026-08-24). Builds on the renderer pipeline of
[21-unified-renderer.md](21-unified-renderer.md) (UI pass: drawn after the final
blit, at whole-pixel UI scale, never world-zoomed, never darkened by lighting) and
the netcode rules of [22-netcode.md](22-netcode.md) (inputs-not-values; cosmetics
predicted, state authoritative). Supersedes the hand-drawn hotbar/toast code and
docs/13's in-canvas UI sketches where they conflict.

The goal: any window is a **composition of generic widgets**, and any inventory
grid is a **binding to a generic container** — so a barrel, a crafting bench, a
chest, the player backpack, and a paper-doll equipment panel are all the same
code path with different compositions and bindings, not bespoke screens.

## 1. Art source and extraction

Source: the owner-licensed **Cute Fantasy UI pack**
(`references/Cute_Fantasy_UI/UI/`). Per the standing licensing decision
(DECISIONS.md 2026-08-24 art/licensing): commit only reviewed, text-authored
derivatives with `sourcePalette` exact ramps — never the source sheets. Follow
docs/10, docs/11, and the `pixel-art` skill for the extract/review loop
(`render-review.ts` sheets, neighbor comparison).

Element families to extract, from the sheets on disk (`UI_ALL.png` is the master;
per-family sheets exist for most). Primary style family is the **wood/parchment
set** already used by the hotbar; extract one accent family (green=confirm,
red=danger) for buttons/selectors, not all eight recolors:

| Family | Asset names | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Panels/frames | `ui_cf_panel_wood`, `ui_cf_panel_parchment`, `ui_cf_frame_thin` | 9-slice (`slice` metadata); the thin large frames at the sheet bottom suit full-screen dialogs |
| Buttons | `ui_cf_button`, `ui_cf_button_small`, `ui_cf_button_accent_{green,red}` | `state` frame groups: `idle`, `pressed`, `disabled`. Ignore the pre-labeled PLAY/OPTIONS pills — labels are always our atlas font over a blank button |
| Slot | `ui_cf_slot` | the square inventory cell from the premade sheet; 9-slice so slot size can vary |
| Selector brackets | `ui_cf_selector_{neutral,confirm,deny}` | 4-corner bracket frames (white/green/red rows); drawn corners-only at any size — selection, drag-target highlight, hotbar bracket |
| Sliders | `ui_cf_slider_track`, `ui_cf_slider_handle` | horizontal 9-slice track + handle sprite |
| Bars | `ui_cf_bar_frame`, `ui_cf_bar_fill_{red,green,blue,gold}` | authored fixed-size player-vitals HUD only; do not stretch it as a generic meter. Resizable loading/task meters use the shared pixel `ProgressBar` primitive with fixed-thickness borders and segmented fill |
| Ribbons | `ui_cf_ribbon`, `ui_cf_banner_flag` | window titles, headers |
| Speech popups | `ui_cf_bubble` + `tail_{up,down,left,right}` state frames | 9-slice body, tail composited at anchor edge |
| Crosshair/cursor | `ui_cf_cursor`, `ui_cf_cursor_click` (animation), `ui_cf_crosshair` | `Pointer_Click_Anim.png`; OS cursor hidden over canvas, cursor drawn in UI pass |
| Icons | extend the existing `icon_cf_*` set as needed | `UI_Icons.png`, `UI_Button_Icons.png` (arrows, check/cross, coin, heart, gear, bag) |
| Book/pages | `ui_cf_book_open`, `ui_cf_book_tab` | `Book_UI.png` — help book plus compact/collapsed HUD tabs; later journal/skill content uses the same widget system |

### Actor asset library and animation lab

The public `/ui-lab` route also exposes the owner-licensed NPC and enemy sheets
through the normal generated-atlas pipeline. `cute-fantasy-actor-library.ts` is
the gameplay-facing catalog: entries have stable asset IDs, role/family metadata,
authored animation-group names, and links to companion projectile, weapon, or VFX
sheets. The import includes profession work (mining, chopping, watering, fishing),
locomotion, combat/casting/hurt/defeat rows, factions, holiday NPCs, skeletons,
slimes, shroomlings, desert enemies, volcano enemies, and authored companions.
Irregular sheets retain neutral `state_XX` labels rather than guessed semantics.

The UI Lab's left catalog reuses existing canonical assets where pixels already
exist (notably full-size snails) and lazily loads only the visible catalog page
and selected actor. The right frame displays every animation for that selection
at once and links its companion sheets. These previews run only while their
district intersects the viewport. Press `A` to jump to the actor library and `C`
to jump to the authored-control catalog. Importing makes the sprites immediately
loadable by game code; it does not spawn or place them in the live world.

### Persistent HUD controls

The zone ribbon owns two independent targets: its lightning ghost button
toggles the online-player list, while the remaining ribbon body collapses into
the authored parchment tab extracted from `Book_UI.png`. Clicking that tab
restores the full zone ribbon. The global crafting wrench, backpack/currency
button, online-player lightning, chat toggle, and storage sort wrenches all
provide hover tooltips; touch operation never depends on hover.

Canvas z-order and input order are the same order. Chat paints beneath modal
windows, and the retained window tree gets first input capture, so an obscured
chat region cannot activate through the window above it.

Every extract carries `slice` and/or `state` frame groups in its sprite JSON so
sizing and states are data, not code. `validate-assets.ts` gains a lint: a `ui`
category asset must declare `slice` or fixed `size` intent, and state groups must
be complete (`idle` at minimum).

Buttons use the shared semantic canvas button renderer/component. Callers choose
`neutral`, `success`, or `danger` rather than selecting colored artwork and
hand-positioning text. Regular buttons reserve 22 UI pixels of height and the
component centers the bitmap-font label within the usable face above the lower
bevel; compact icon controls explicitly opt into the 16-pixel variant.

## 2. Widget system

A small **retained widget tree**, in `packages/client/src/ui/` (the module
docs/02 always reserved), rendered by the doc 21 UI pass. No DOM, no framework.

- **Core interface:** `Widget { layout(constraints): Size; draw(ctx, origin); onPointer?(e); onKey?(e) }`
  with container widgets owning children. All geometry is integer UI pixels;
  the UI pass applies the whole-pixel UI scale (Shift `-`/`+` ladder) globally.
- **Layout:** the shared pixel-snapped flex/grid engine supports asymmetric
  padding, gaps, alignment, wrapping, and explicit `fit`, `grow`, `fixed`, and
  parent-percentage sizing with minimum/maximum bounds. Attach points position
  close controls, ribbons, bookmarks, tooltips, and popovers without resizing
  their authored pixels. Minimum sizes derive from 9-slice insets and content;
  component-width variants provide container-query-style reflow. The legacy
  row/column helpers delegate to this engine rather than maintaining a second
  implementation.
- **Widget set (v1):** `Panel`, `Window` (frame + ribbon title + close button;
  draggable by title; position remembered per window kind in local settings),
  `Button` (state frames + icon and/or label, keyboard/gamepad activatable),
  `Label` (atlas font, wrapping), `Icon`, `Bar`, `Slider` (drives audio volume
  first), `InventoryGrid` (cols×rows of `Slot`), `Slot` (item icon + quantity
  label + selector bracket states), `Tooltip` (hover, delayed), `SpeechBubble`
  (world-anchored: follows an entity's screen position from the world transform,
  drawn in the UI pass), `Cursor`.
- **Input routing:** stable unique widget IDs expose final layout rectangles for
  inspection and tests. Pointer events hit-test the tree in reverse paint order
  *before* the world receives them. Layers explicitly declare `capture` or
  `passthrough`; modal capture includes wheel input, while decorative overlays
  can reveal the next eligible control beneath them. `Esc` closes the top window;
  open windows capture movement keys only when a text field has focus (none in
  v1). One shared focus/z-order manager; the existing `InputController` stays
  the single entry point.
- **Input modality is client-local:** touch shows the joystick/action controls
  only in the browser tab that observed that touch; mouse or pen input in that
  same tab restores pointer UI and the in-game cursor. Modality never belongs in
  an identity/player row, so simultaneous clients for one character may present
  different controls while intentionally sharing authoritative movement state.
- **Migration:** the hand-drawn hotbar becomes `Window`-less anchored
  `InventoryGrid` bound to the hotbar container; toasts become a `Label` queue
  widget; player name tags move to `SpeechBubble`'s positioning helper. The F3
  debug overlay stays raw text (not widgetized).

### Storage-frame compositions

All windows containing item containers must use the implemented composition and
resizing contract in [38-storage-frame-system.md](38-storage-frame-system.md).
That contract supersedes screen-local slot offsets: it derives minimum frame
size from one or more declared panes, guarantees hotbar width, distributes fixed
panes with equal gutters, allocates surplus width to explicit flex panes, and
provides the shared corner-resize interaction used for layout testing.

## 3. Cursor-stack inventory interaction

The private `inventory_cursor` row is real server-owned item custody. Missing
means empty. A left click takes a whole stack; right click takes its larger half.
Further clicks place, merge, or swap from that cursor, and mouse release alone
does nothing. Closing a menu returns it to hotbar/backpack, then durable overflow;
disconnect runs the same recovery.

While a cursor stack is held, left-drag visits unique compatible slots and commits
one even `QUICK_CRAFT` transaction on release; right-drag places one per visited
slot. Shift is not involved. Double-click collects compatible stacks to the item
maximum, Shift-click uses the menu's merge-then-empty route, number keys swap the
hovered cell with a hotbar cell, and Q/Control-Q throw one/the full hovered stack.
All client highlights are advisory; the reducer re-resolves ownership, open-menu
reach, restrictions, metadata compatibility, capacity, and exact quantities.

## 4. Generic containers (the data model that makes it composable)

**Schema (additive, replaces `inventory_slot` — one model for every grid):**

- `container` table: `id`, `kind` (`'player_backpack' | 'player_hotbar' | 'barrel' | 'crafting_grid' | …`),
  `ownerIdentity: option`, `capacity: u8`, and for world containers a
  `chunkX/chunkY` btree index (subscribed with the region like resources).
- `container_slot` table: `containerId` + `index` (unique pair), `itemKind`,
  `quantity`. Absent row = empty slot.
- Visibility: world-container slots are public rows (friends-scale game; contents
  visible when the chunk is subscribed). Player containers are exposed through a
  caller-filtered view exactly like today's `own_inventory_slots`.
- World props that hold items (a placed barrel) are entity rows carrying a
  `containerId`. Placement/creation of such props is M7 content; the model and a
  dev-spawned test barrel land now.

**Reducer surface (inputs-not-values, per doc 22):**

- `moveItem(fromContainer, fromIndex, toContainer, toIndex, quantity)` — the
  *only* mutation drag-drop ever emits. One transaction validates: both
  containers exist; sender owns-or-can-reach each (player containers: identity
  match; world containers: authoritative position within 2 tiles, same reach rule
  as harvest); indexes in capacity; item stacking/merge/swap/split rules from a
  shared `packages/sim` items module (max stack sizes, kind-restricted slots —
  e.g. an equipment slot accepts only its gear kind later). Move, swap, merge,
  and split are all outcomes of this one reducer, decided server-side.
- `craft(recipeId, gridContainerId)` — validates the grid contents against a
  recipe table in `packages/sim`, consumes inputs and inserts the result in the
  same transaction. Recipes/content are a later milestone; the reducer shape and
  result-slot UI land with a single dev recipe.
- Client-supplied values are ids, indexes, and a quantity — the server re-derives
  everything else. No item kind, no stack contents, no reach claim.

**Bindings:** `InventoryGrid` takes a `ContainerBinding` (container id or
`'self:backpack'`/`'self:hotbar'`) and renders whatever the subscribed rows say.
Because every grid is a binding, **a barrel window, the crafting window, the
backpack, and the paper-doll panel are compositions**:

- Barrel: `Window("Barrel", InventoryGrid(bind(barrel.containerId), 4×2))` —
  opened by `E` on the faced barrel, closed by walking out of reach (client
  closes; server enforces reach on every move anyway).
- Crafting: `Window("Crafting", Row(InventoryGrid(bind(grid), 3×3), Icon(arrow), Slot(result)), Button("Craft"))`.
- Player: `Window("Pack", Row(Column(paperDollSlots…), InventoryGrid(bind('self:backpack'), 5×4)))`
  mirroring the `UI_Premade.png` layout; equipment slots are a kind-restricted
  container, wired later.

## 5. Out of scope

Gamepad/touch UI navigation (input hooks exist; bindings later), text input
widgets, the book/journal, actual crafting recipe content, equipment gameplay
effects, container-placement gameplay, chat.

## 6. Tests and acceptance

- Unit: layout math (rows/columns/anchors/min-sizes), 9-slice edge cases (size
  smaller than insets), `DragContext` transitions (grab/hover/drop/cancel/error),
  shared stacking rules (merge/swap/split, capacity, kind restriction — same
  fixtures run against the reducer via the world test harness), slot binding
  renders from row fixtures, input routing (UI click does not reach world; wheel
  over slider vs world).
- Two-client: A drops an item into the dev barrel, B sees it appear; A and B race
  moving the same stack — one wins, one gets the error shake, no duplication;
  out-of-reach move rejected.
- Browser: open/drag/close windows at UI scales 1–3 and fractional world zoom
  (UI stays whole-pixel crisp); hotbar unchanged in behavior; cursor renders with
  click animation; tooltip on hover; speech bubble tracks a moving player.

## 7. Bookkeeping

Update docs/13 (point it at this spec for implemented surface) and docs/08
(container tables). DECISIONS.md entries: Cute Fantasy UI element adoption with
wood/parchment as primary family; retained widget tree in `client/src/ui`;
generic container/`moveItem` model replacing `inventory_slot`; drag-drop as
cosmetic-ghost + single-intent-reducer.
