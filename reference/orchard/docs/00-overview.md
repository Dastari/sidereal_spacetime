# Orchard & Cellar — Design & Technical Documentation

> You inherit a neglected orchard and a cellar full of empty racks. Walk the rows,
> bring the estate back to life, bottle a vintage worth your family's name — then
> hand it on, generation after generation.

A cozy, Stardew-Valley-style pixel-art farm game, adapted from the incremental web
game *Orchard & Cellar*, implementing its redesign document's recommendations,
rebuilt as an avatar-controlled, friends-only persistent sanctuary overworld where
players discover symbolic POIs and zone into farms, resource areas, towns, and events
together. The source captures are summarized in docs 16
and 17; raw captures and licensed packs stay in the ignored local `references/`
directory and are never published. Built end-to-end by AI agents following this doc
suite.

**Headline decisions** (rationale in the docs):
- **TypeScript + HTML5 Canvas 2D**, custom micro-engine — *not* Rust/Bevy (01)
- One deterministic simulation package shared by client & world authority (02)
- SpaceTimeDB 2.8 is the binding realtime authority and durable store after passing
  the M5.5 architecture gate; generated subscriptions stream the shared world (19)
- Friends-only sanctuary overworld connecting cooperative Homesteads, resource/danger
  zones, towns, and authored destinations (40; amends 07, 19, 20, 30, and 35)
- All art & audio authored as text (pixel-grid JSON, tracker JSON) and compiled —
  enforceable style consistency for agent-made assets (10–12)
- Prestige is diegetic: **Vintage = build, Succession = power, Lineage = rules** (05, 06)

Minimal startup ritual for an implementing agent: **00 → 01 → 02 → 15 → your
milestone in 14 → the docs that milestone lists.** Docs are binding; deviations go
through DECISIONS.md (15 §2). Project skills installed in `.claude/skills/`:
`asset-discovery`, `pixel-art`, `game-music`, `balance-tuning`. Use
`asset-discovery` before manually searching for an entity, tile/tileset,
resource/item, skill icon, prop, building, sprite, or animation source.

## Source material

- The original incremental capture and redesign PDF are local-only material in the
  ignored `references/` directory; they are not part of the published repository.

Docs 16/17 summarize both faithfully; implementers should rarely need the raw files.
