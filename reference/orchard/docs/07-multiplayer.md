# 07 — Persistent Overworld, Co-op & Social

> **Superseded world shape (2026-08-26):** [40](40-sanctuary-overworld-and-zoned-world.md)
> replaces continuous literal-scale estates and a generally destructible wilderness
> with a safe sanctuary overworld, symbolic POIs, and `spaceId` Homestead/resource/
> danger/social destinations. Permission, presence, chat, transaction, and 25-friend
> requirements below remain binding where compatible.

Binding multiplayer design after the owner expanded Orchard & Cellar into a private,
friends-only cozy MMO and the M5.5 SpaceTimeDB gate passed. The adopted target now
connects estates and other full-scale destinations through sanctuary-overworld POIs.

## 1. World model

- One shared world clock and deterministic generated island contain wilderness,
  common spaces, resources, and player homestead clearings. Generation and the
  survival loop are specified in [20-survival-world.md](20-survival-world.md).
- A player has one durable avatar position and one owned farm. Friends may walk onto
  an estate and cooperate while its owner is online or offline, subject to permissions.
- Public spatial entities use indexed chunk coordinates. Each client subscribes to a
  3×3 chunk region and hands regions over subscribe-first.
- Movement is server-authoritative at 20 Hz with 60 Hz local prediction and remote
  interpolation. Interactions are transactional reducers.
- Small-group launch target is 25 concurrent friends. M9 must measure CPU, bandwidth,
  memory, and reconciliation under that load before deployment.

## 2. Estate permissions

Every farm has an owner and an access mode: `friends`, `invited`, or `closed`.
Per-member roles may grant `visitor`, `helper`, or `steward`. The authority checks the
current role for every reducer; UI visibility is never authorization.

| Action | Visitor | Helper | Steward | Owner |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Walk, emote, taste, pet dog | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Helping-hand tend | yes, 5/host-day | yes | yes | yes |
| Harvest into host stores | no | yes | yes | yes |
| Feed/empty machines | no | yes | yes | yes |
| Spend host currency or buy upgrades | no | no | yes | yes |
| Move/place/delete objects | no | no | permission-gated | yes |
| Prestige, permissions, farm deletion | no | no | no | yes |

Helping-hand tending grants Care to the host tree and never pays fruit to the visitor.
Shared harvest/machine operations mutate the host farm exactly once in a transaction.
Co-op must not duplicate inventory, rewards, Vigour, or first-event Knowledge.

## 3. Friends and discovery

- No public server browser and no global chat.
- Production connection requires approved membership per [09-auth.md](09-auth.md).
- The Estate Book lists members, online presence, farm name, public prestige summary,
  role, favorite, and navigate-to-estate action.
- Estate gates and the world map provide directions; a teleport shortcut may unlock
  later but never replaces the walkable route.
- Blocking removes estate access, hides authored text, and prevents direct social
  interactions. Owner/moderators can revoke world membership.

## 4. Social verbs

Retain the cozy launch verbs from the original design:

- Guestbook: 140 characters, one entry per visitor per host-day; host can delete.
- Gift basket: one gift per pair/day from an explicit gift pouch; transactional
  removal and claim prevent duplication.
- Tasting table: shows a public vintage label and grants the documented time-limited
  good-company buff.
- Proximity chat bubbles: 120 characters, bitmap-font charset, one message per two
  seconds. No persistent global channel.
- Six emotes, festival participation, and dog petting.

All authored text passes authority-side charset, length, denylist, block, and rate
checks. Reports retain the offending text plus identities in a private moderation row.

## 5. Clock, offline farms, and presence

The overworld uses one shared seasonal clock. A farm stores the timestamp represented
by its economy state and advances lazily when entered or mutated. Occupied farms may
receive slow targeted maintenance; absent farms do not tick globally.

Positions persist across disconnects, but only identities with at least one live
connection are rendered online. Multiple tabs for one identity remain online until
the last connection closes. Reconnect restores the identity and authoritative
position before accepting input.
After the presence lease expires, a nearby persisted position remains visible as a
non-interactive stone-tinted avatar with its real appearance and name. An animated
lightning glyph inside the nameplate marks that player as offline. These statues emit
no held light, cannot be selected or traded with, do not appear as live minimap
markers, and do not participate in placement or movement collision.

World-entry and final-disconnect notices are session UI, not authored chat. They are
delivered through each connection's private bounded notice inbox and are discarded
when that recipient logs out, so reconnecting never restores them as chat history.
The owner-only `/last` diagnostic reads the retained private connection audit and copies
at most the 12 newest login/logout events, with explicit UTC times, into only the
requesting connection's same ephemeral chat-console inbox. It never writes General,
whispers, world speech, or persistent chat history. Repeated events for the same player
and action are collapsed into the newest event within each rolling five-second window;
a login followed by a logout remains two distinct events.
The public `/baltop` command similarly projects only the ten highest authoritative
wallet balances, with public display names, into the requesting connection's ephemeral
chat-console inbox. Raw wallet rows remain private, and the result never enters General
or durable chat history.

## 6. Implementation order

1. **M5.5 complete:** durable shared chunk, two predicted avatars, shared atomic tree,
   reconnect, restart persistence, private-state isolation.
2. **M5.6 complete, owner-directed sample:** up to 25 persistent adjacent parcel
   slots, live crop stages, owner plant/harvest, and nearby-friend watering. This is
   deliberately one reducer and one crop type; it proves the contiguous farm loop
   before the complete permission matrix and economy move server-side.
3. **M6:** OIDC + friends allowlist, owned farm/public/private tables, local-save
   import, farm timestamp adapter, self-host deploy and backup/restore.
4. **M5.7 complete historical vertical slice:** generated island terrain, biomes, resource
   collision, distinct spawn clearings, private inventory views, starter hotbar, and
   transactional tree harvesting.
5. **M5.11 next (doc 40 §8):** test forest/cave/deeper-underground destinations plus
   a Marlow-sold deed and compact tent POI leading to a durable owner Homestead;
   dynamic definitions, transition isolation, cache bounds, and occupied-space work.
6. **Sanctuary migration:** author/validate static scenery and symbolic POIs, move
   destructive resources into zones, then authority-disable overworld destruction and
   combat through a versioned reconciliation.
7. **Homesteads:** production farming/building/residence spaces and estate access
   modes with the guest/worker/builder reducer matrix from docs 35/40.
8. **Social/content:** friends UI, guestbook, gifts, tasting, proximity chat,
   blocks/moderation, towns, festivals, reconnect/rollback soak, and owner host tools.

## 7. Required tests

- Every permission-table cell has an allowed/denied reducer test.
- Two identities racing a harvest, machine, gift claim, or purchase commit once.
- Chunk crossings do not lose or duplicate entities and old subscriptions close.
- Artificial latency/loss keeps local movement responsive and reconciles exactly.
- Block/revoke takes effect on active connections and private views remain isolated.
- Offline advance is identical whether a farm is entered by owner or permitted friend.
- Twenty-five simulated friends meet the M9 resource/latency budget.

## Status note (2026-08-26)

The permissioned-estates concept in this doc is realized by
[35-homesteads-and-farming.md](35-homesteads-and-farming.md) (instanced
homesteads, role-tiered guest access, owner-controlled requests). Where the
two differ, doc 35 wins; [40](40-sanctuary-overworld-and-zoned-world.md) is newer
than both and governs the sanctuary/POI/zoned-world shape.
