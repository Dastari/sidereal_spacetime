# 28 — Crafting Expansion: Materials, Stations, Recipes, and Placeables

Binding owner-directed spec (2026-08-25). Status: **phases 1–3 implemented
(2026-08-26); the phase-4 furnace, metal refinement, and barrel gate implemented
(2026-08-28); anvil gear, gem cutting, and later phases remain planned**.
Per [40](40-sanctuary-overworld-and-zoned-world.md), freeform placement is confined
to authorized Homestead/interior/resource destination spaces. The target sanctuary
overworld accepts no general placement or dropped-item clutter; its dedicated deed
transaction creates only a compact POI. Existing space-aware crafting authority is
retained and reused inside destinations.
Builds on [23-ui-system.md](23-ui-system.md) (grid/recipe/container machinery — the
"recipes/content are a later milestone" it deferred is this doc),
[20-survival-world.md](20-survival-world.md) (resource drops, tool-strip roster),
[25-stats-and-vitals.md](25-stats-and-vitals.md) (equipment modifiers, INT quality
hook, `orchard_tea`), [26-underground-mines.md](26-underground-mines.md) (torch/
lantern/gem items this doc gives recipes to), and
[27-lighting-design.md](27-lighting-design.md) (placeable light emitters).
Recipe *numbers* mirror into [06-progression-economy.md](06-progression-economy.md)
per standing policy.

Design mandate: **Minecraft-style** — gather raw materials, refine them through
stations, craft tools/gear/placeables on a grid — with content **strictly limited
to art the licensed paid packs provide** (docs/18 §7; `Cute_Fantasy_Free` is
non-commercial and contributes nothing here). Every item in this doc is
art-verified against a pack sheet; the inventory sweep is §3/§11.

## 1. Baseline — what exists and what must be fixed first

Shipped today: 26 item kinds; a 3×3 crafting grid always available in the
inventory (`C`); shaped + shapeless recipe matching in `item-containers.ts`; the
`craftInventoryRecipe` reducer re-validating server-side (inputs-not-values);
chest containers end-to-end; `useHands` place/carry/pickup **hardcoded to
chests**. Baseline recipes are `1 wood → 4 plank`, `2 plank → 4 stick`,
`1 stick + 1 stone → 4 arrow`, and `8 plank → chest`. There is **no ore sink at
all** — eight ore kinds, 32 units per node, zero consumers. Barrel is a UI shell
(item + window, no table/recipe/placement). Fruit-tree pickups are obtainable;
grapes remain unobtainable. Fishing/sword/lantern/torch from the docs/20 tool
strip don't exist as items.

### 1.1 Implemented inventory-safety baseline

- A private authoritative cursor stack now owns picked-up items independently of
  their source slot. Mouse release does not place or return that stack.
- Left quick-craft evenly deposits `floor(cursor count / eligible slots)` in every
  visited compatible slot and leaves the remainder on the cursor; right
  quick-craft deposits one per visited slot. Neither gesture requires Shift.
- Shift-double-click atomically transfers every matching item on the selected
  inventory side. Double-click fills the compatible cursor stack. Shift-taking a
  recipe repeats until source or full inventory capacity is exhausted, including
  across more than one output stack.
- Every reducer remains transaction-scoped. Transient crafting items that
  cannot return to normal storage enter private `inventory_overflow` custody;
  world ticks and reconnects drain those rows into hotbar/backpack as space opens.
- Placed chests use licensed six-frame `Chest_Anim.png`, expose 27 storage cells,
  block movement, and the nearest one within a two-tile radial reach opens through
  E without requiring the player to face its exact tile. Three authoritative axe hits break a chest
  and spill its recipe inputs (currently eight planks) plus every stored stack as
  world pickups. It does not also drop an intact chest, preventing salvage loops.
- Fruit trees drop their matching fruit pickup as well as timber when felled.

Required fixes folded into phase 1 (each is a landmine for content authoring):

1. **Shaped matching becomes shift-invariant**: normalize a recipe to its
   bounding box and match at any grid offset (`recipeMatches` currently anchors
   at index 0, so a 2×2 recipe only matches top-left). No mirroring (like
   Minecraft, patterns are handed).
2. **One item registry, not four edit sites.** `ItemDefinition` gains
   `displayName` (and `iconKey` defaulting to `icon_cf_<kind>` /
   `item_cf_<kind>` by convention); `HOTBAR_LABELS`/`HOTBAR_NAMES` and the
   `OverworldUiItemArt` wiring derive from it. Adding an item becomes: one
   definition entry + sprite files.
3. **Delete the drifted `compositions.ts` crafting path** (its `dev_planks`
   recipe id doesn't exist) or re-point it at real ids — test-only, but rot.
4. **The "workbench" naming collision is resolved**: docs/06 §"Workbench…
   upgrades" (the fruit-currency upgrade *shop* of the retired farm scene) is
   renamed "farmhouse upgrade counter" in the docs; from this doc on,
   **workbench = the placeable crafting station**. Recorded in DECISIONS.

## 2. The design shape

Three chains, Minecraft's spine adapted to our verbs:

```
gather                refine                      make
──────                ──────                      ────
wood  ──────────────▶ plank ──▶ stick ──────────▶ tools, fences, signs, stations
pebbles ─▶ (3×3) ─▶ stone ───────────────────────▶ furnace, arrows
metal pieces ─▶ (3×3) ─▶ ore ─▶ (furnace + fuel) ─▶ bars ─▶ barrels, later metal gear
gem ores ────────────▶ (anvil) ─▶ cut gems ──────▶ jewelry (with gold bars)
fiber (tilling) ─────────────────────────────────▶ torch, bow, fishing rod
```

- **Grid crafting stays the one interaction.** No station has its own crafting
  UI except the furnace (which is stateful, §5.2). Stations gate recipes by
  **proximity**: a recipe tagged `station: 'workbench'` crafts in your normal
  3×3 grid only while a placed workbench is within reach (2 tiles — the chest
  reach rule). The result slot shows the match with a lock overlay and
  "REQUIRES WORKBENCH" tooltip when the station is missing. This keeps one UI,
  one reducer (now also checking station proximity server-side), and still
  makes placing your first workbench a real progression beat.
- **Hand recipes** (no `station` field) stay craftable anywhere — planks,
  sticks, torches, campfire: the "stranded on the beach" tier.
- **Placeables are the output that changes the world** (§7): stations, fences,
  barrels, signs, light sources — generalizing the chest placement path.

## 3. New items (all art-verified, paid packs only)

Existing 26 kinds keep their ids. New kinds, with art source:

| Item | Stack | Tags (new vocab in bold) | Art source |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `stick` | 99 | item.resource, material.wood | `Icons/Resources_Icons` sheet |
| `fiber` | 99 | item.resource, **material.fiber** | `Icons/Resources_Icons` sheet |
| `pebble`; `iron/copper/gold_piece` | 99 | item.resource, **material.raw** | world stone art; `Icons/Resources_Icons` small stages |
| `iron_bar`, `copper_bar`, `gold_bar` | 99 | item.resource, **material.bar**, metal.\<x\> | `Icons/Resources_Icons` (bar icons) |
| `gem_emerald/sapphire/topaz/ruby/amethyst` | 99 | item.resource, **material.gem** | `Icons/Resources_Icons`; mines doc's gem items |
| `torch`, `lantern` | 16 / 1 | item.tool, gear.hand, **emits.light** | `Player/Tools/Other/*`, `Lantern_Torch.png` (doc 26 §6) |
| `sword` | 1 | item.tool, gear.hand, **item.weapon** | `Player/Tools/Iron/Iron_Sword.png` + tool icon |
| `bow` | 1 | item.tool, gear.hand, item.weapon | `Bow/Wooden_Bow.png`, `Other/Bow_Stages.png` |
| `arrow` | 99 | **item.ammo** | tool icon strip |
| `fishing_rod` | 1 | item.tool, gear.hand | `Fishing_Rod/Wooden_Fishing_Rod.png` |
| `workbench` | 16 | item.placeable, item.crafted, **station.workbench** | `House_Decor/Tables.png` (worktable frame) |
| `furnace` | 16 | item.placeable, item.crafted, **station.furnace** | `House_Decor/Furnace_Anim.png`, `Furnaces.png` |
| `anvil` | 16 | item.placeable, item.crafted, **station.anvil** | `House_Decor/Anvil_Anim.png` |
| `campfire` | 16 | item.placeable, station.campfire, emits.light | `Other_Animations/Campfire_Anim.png` |
| `fence`, `fence_gate` | 99 / 16 | item.placeable, **build.fence** | committed `prop_cf_fence_*` + `Fence_Big_Gate*.png` |
| `sign` | 16 | item.placeable | `Outdoor decoration/Signs.png` |
| `standing_torch` | 16 | item.placeable, emits.light | `Torch_Anim.png`, `Lanter_Posts.png` |

Notes: the existing `*_ore` items for the five gem kinds read as "raw gem
chunks" and stay named as-is; cutting yields `gem_*`. The existing free-granted
tools remain; crafted tools are replacements/spares until tool tiers arrive
(§12 later hooks — the pack's single iron tool set means tiers need palette-swap
derivatives, which the license permits and assets-as-text makes cheap).
Gear items (`helm`…`shield`) finally become obtainable via §6 and carry doc 25
`modifiers` (small flat bonuses; numbers in the docs/06 mirror).

## 4. Recipe system upgrades (`packages/sim/src/item-containers.ts` → split out `recipes.ts`)

```ts
export interface RecipeDefinition {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly kind: 'shaped' | 'shapeless';
  readonly pattern?: ReadonlyArray<ReadonlyArray<string | null>>; // bounding-box, shift-invariant
  readonly inputs?: Readonly<Record<string, number>>;             // shapeless
  readonly output: { readonly itemKind: string; readonly quantity: number };
  readonly station?: 'workbench' | 'furnace' | 'anvil' | 'campfire';
}
```

- Furnace recipes are data here too, but execute through the smelting model
  (§5.2), not the grid.
- `craftInventoryRecipe` gains the station-proximity check: a `world_placeable`
  row of the required station kind within 2 tiles in the caller's space,
  else `station_required` SenderError.
- **INT quality hook (doc 25 §1) is reserved, not spent**: recipes have no
  quality rolls in v1. First use will be cooking quality when food lands.

## 5. Stations

### 5.1 Workbench, anvil, campfire — stateless proximity gates
Placeable props; no windows, no slots, no rows beyond their `world_placeable`
entry. Campfire and standing torch register in the doc 27 emitter table
(flame flicker, warm color) — placed light is a crafting output, which is the
mines' torch economy extended to bases.

### 5.2 Furnace — the one stateful station
Minecraft's furnace, on our lazy-tick pattern (no per-tick work):

- Interacting opens a 3-slot window (input / fuel / output) — the chest window
  machinery with a 3-slot container (`world_placeable_slot`, same shape as
  `world_chest_slot`).
- Row state: `smeltStartTick: u64 | null`. A smelt starts when input+fuel are
  valid; progress is derived from `authorityTick − smeltStartTick` at read
  time (`SMELT_TICKS = 6000` = 5 real minutes per unit, catch-up
  for multiple units on reopen — walk whole units, consume fuel per unit,
  stop when input/fuel/output-space runs out).
- Fuel values: `wood = 1 smelt`, `plank = 1`, `stick = 0` (not fuel — keeps
  sticks for building). No coal exists in our ore set; wood **is** the fuel
  economy, which gives chopping a permanent sink.
- Client shows progress with the doc 25 bar assets (gold fill) — derived,
  not streamed.

## 6. Recipe list v1 (the content; numbers mirror to docs/06)

**Hand (anywhere):**

| Recipe | Inputs | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Planks | 1 wood | 4 plank *(exists)* |
| Sticks | 2 plank (vertical) | 4 stick |
| Torch | 1 wood + 1 fiber | 2 torch *(honors doc 26's wood+fiber recipe)* |
| Campfire | 3 wood + 3 stick | 1 campfire |
| Workbench | 4 plank (2×2) | 1 workbench |
| Stone | 9 pebble (3×3) | 1 stone |
| Metal ore chunk | 9 matching metal pieces (3×3) | 1 ore chunk |

**Workbench:**

| Recipe | Inputs | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Chest | 8 plank ring | 1 chest *(exists; moves behind workbench)* |
| Barrel | 6 plank + 2 iron_bar | 1 barrel *(8-slot container; crop-curing gate)* |
| Fence | 4 plank + 2 stick | 3 fence |
| Fence gate | 2 plank + 4 stick | 1 fence_gate |
| Sign | 6 plank + 1 stick | 1 sign |
| Standing torch | 1 torch + 1 stick | 1 standing_torch |
| Furnace | 8 stone ring | 1 furnace |
| Bow | 3 stick + 3 fiber | 1 bow |
| Arrows | 1 stick + 1 stone | 4 arrow |
| Fishing rod | 3 stick (diagonal) + 2 fiber | 1 fishing_rod |
| Axe / Pickaxe | 3 bar (iron) + 2 stick | 1 tool |
| Hoe / Sword | 2 bar (iron) + 1–2 stick | 1 tool |
| Watering can | 3 copper_bar | 1 watering_can |
| Lantern | 4 iron_bar + 1 torch | 1 lantern *(doc 26 "crafted with iron")* |

**Furnace (smelting):** `1 iron_ore → 1 iron_bar` · `1 copper_ore → 1 copper_bar`
· `1 gold_ore → 1 gold_bar` (each consumes one wood or plank). Gem ores are
not smeltable. Each bar sells for exactly twice its ore plus one wood fuel's
sell opportunity cost.

**Anvil:** gem cutting `2 <gem>_ore → 1 gem_<x>` · Anvil itself: 6 iron_bar
(workbench) · Plate gear: helm 5 / tunic 8 / pants 7 / boots 4 / gloves 2
iron_bar; shield 1 iron_bar + 6 plank · Jewelry: ring = 1 gold_bar + 1 gem;
necklace = 2 gold_bar + 1 gem (gem choice varies the doc 25 modifier).

**Gated on other systems (recipes authored, disabled until inputs exist):**
`orchard_tea` (doc 25 — needs obtainable apples), campfire cooking (the pack's
96 food icons are the ceiling; needs farming/foraging yields — docs/14 owns
sequencing). Listed so the docs/06 mirror shows the full intended tree.

## 7. Placement — generalizing the chest path

`useHands`' chest-only dispatch becomes tag-driven:

- **New table `world_placeable`**: `{ id: u64 pk, kind: string, tileX/Y: u16,
  chunkX/Y: i16, spaceId: u8, placedBy: Identity, facing? }` + `by_chunk`
  (spaceId, chunkX, chunkY) index and chunk subscription like `world_chest`.
  Chests stay in their existing table (migration not worth it); everything new
  goes here.
- Place: selected item has `item.placeable` → consume 1, insert row at the
  faced tile (walkable, unoccupied, in-bounds, same space). Pick up: `useHands`
  on a placeable you can reach returns the item (barrels must be empty and return
  to inventory; furnaces retain their slots and are carried over the player's head like anvils;
  the chest carry-with-contents behavior stays chest-only).
- Collision: blocking per item definition (stations, fences block; standing
  torch doesn't). Client + authority collision maps add placeable AABBs
  exactly as chests do today. Fences render with the existing corner/
  horizontal/vertical sprites by neighbor-adjacency (fence-join rules, a mini
  autotile); gates toggle open/closed via interact (passable when open).
- Placeables are space-aware from day one (`spaceId`) — you can furnish a mine
  gallery with standing torches, which is doc 26's light economy working.
- Griefing scope: friends-only server, any member may pick up placeables;
  `placedBy` is recorded for a future permission pass — explicitly out of
  scope now.

## 8. New acquisition: fiber

One small addition closes the string/fiber gap every tool chain hits (no
animals, no coal, no spider-string in our world yet): **tilling a wild grass
tile with the hoe has a 30% (hash-gated, deterministic) chance to also drop
1 `fiber`** — cut roots and grass twine. It rides the existing `useFarmTool`
path, costs the normal Vigour, and gives the hoe a gathering identity beyond
farming. Mushroom/berry foraging stays with the farming/food milestone.

## 9. UI

- **Crafting window gains a recipe list** (lite recipe book): right of the
  grid, a scrollable list of learned recipes whose station requirement is met,
  greyed when ingredients are missing; clicking one ghost-fills the grid
  pattern from inventory. Recipe discovery is private authority state streamed
  through `own_known_recipes`; it affects guide visibility and ghost-fill only.
  A manually arranged valid pattern remains craftable even when undiscovered.
  New characters know no recipes. Reading the consumable book rewarded by
  Marlow reveals the starter production and building set. The
  pack's `Book_UI.png` full recipe book is a later polish item.
- Result-slot lock state + station tooltip (§2). Furnace window per §5.2.
- Icon debt paid via the §1.2 registry + `Icons/Outline` sheets: every item in
  §3 plus the currently icon-less `apple/grape/barrel/backpack` and gear kinds
  get `icon_cf_*` extracts (the Food/Resources/Tool icon sheets cover all of
  them — verified).

## 10. Schema additions (docs/08: all additive)

`world_placeable` + `world_placeable_slot` (+ views/subscriptions);
`smeltStartTick` on `world_placeable`; no changes to `inventory_slot`
(docs/23's generic-container migration remains outstanding and is *not*
blocking — this doc builds on the shipped offsets model). New SenderErrors:
`station_required`, `placement_blocked`, `placeable_not_empty`.

## 11. Art extraction plan (docs/11/18 workflow; `pixel-art` skill)

New extracts, all from paid packs: item + icon sprites for every §3 kind
(`Icons/Outline/{Tool,Resources,Food}_Icons`, `Iron_Sword/Iron_Tools`,
bow/rod/torch/lantern held overlays for the character action layers);
`prop_cf_workbench`, `prop_cf_furnace` (anim), `prop_cf_anvil` (anim),
`prop_cf_campfire` (anim), `prop_cf_sign`, `prop_cf_standing_torch` (anim),
`prop_cf_fence_gate` (open/closed); barrel already committed. Break
animations (`Barrel_1_Anim`, `Crate_Anim`) noted for a future
destructibility pass. The committed fence sprites are reused as the placeable
art directly.

## 12. Phasing

1. **Foundations:** shift-invariant matching, item registry consolidation
   (displayName/icon convention), recipe registry split, stale-composition
   cleanup. Pure sim + client, ships alone.
2. **Materials + hand tier:** stick/fiber items, fiber-from-tilling, hand
   recipes, icons for all existing icon-less items.
3. **Placement + workbench:** `world_placeable`, generalized `useHands`,
   workbench + proximity gating, fences/gates/signs/barrels-for-real,
   standing torch + campfire (doc 27 emitters).
4. **Metal + anvil:** furnace + smelting model, bars, anvil, metal tools,
   plate gear with doc 25 modifiers, gem cutting + jewelry. *The ore sink —
   the single biggest economy gap — closes here.* **Furnace/refinement slice shipped 2026-08-28.**
5. **Weapons + rod:** sword/bow/arrow/fishing_rod items (usable swing for
   sword via the actions registry; shooting and fishing mechanics remain
   with their own milestones).
6. **Later hooks:** tool tiers via palette-swap ramps; cooking (96 food
   icons ceiling) once farming yields exist; recipe book UI; furniture/
   interior placeables (Beds/Tables/Chairs sheets) with the interiors
   milestone; destructible placeables; placement permissions. Tool durability
   and renewable field repairs ship earlier with docs/25 §4.1; the anvil may
   later improve repair efficiency but is not required to avoid a softlock.

## 13. Out of scope

Cooking/food execution (recipes pre-authored, disabled); farming/crop yield
fixes (separate milestone — but noted: crafting content assumes it lands);
trade/vendors; building placement (houses); the docs/23 generic-container
schema migration; combat mechanics for sword/bow; fishing mechanics;
quality/INT rolls. The former no-durability rule is superseded by docs/25 §4.1:
tools wear but never disappear, and renewable field repair preserves the cozy
no-softlock rule.

## 14. Tests and acceptance

- **Unit (sim):** shift-invariant shaped matching goldens (2×2 pattern at all
  4+ offsets, non-match on mirror, null-cell strictness); every §6 recipe has
  a golden test named `06§<mirror-section>`; smelting catch-up math
  (multi-unit, fuel exhaustion, output-full stop); fiber drop hash
  determinism; fence-join adjacency resolution.
- **Reducer:** craft happy path per station + `station_required` at 3 tiles;
  place/pickup round-trip for each placeable kind; `placement_blocked` on
  occupied/unwalkable/cross-space; furnace slot auth (only reachable players);
  non-empty pickup rejection; auth-failure path each (docs/15).
- **Two-client:** A places a workbench, B crafts at it; B picks it up, A's
  in-flight craft rejects; furnace progress consistent across both clients'
  derived views; placed standing torch lights for both (doc 27 two-client
  test reused).
- **Browser:** recipe list filter/ghost-fill; lock tooltip; furnace window
  progress bar; fence auto-joining as segments are placed; full chain
  playthrough — chop → planks → workbench → furnace → smelt → anvil → sword —
  on one client session.

## 15. Bookkeeping

- **docs/06:** new section mirroring §6 recipes + smelt/fuel constants +
  gear modifier numbers; rename §"Workbench, capacity, and compost upgrades"
  to "Farmhouse upgrade counter" (content unchanged, retired-scene).
- **docs/00:** doc-map row. **docs/14:** milestone entry for §12 phases.
- **docs/20:** tool strip roster note pointing here for item sourcing.
- **docs/26:** §6 torch recipe confirmed (wood + fiber); gem items now §3/§6
  here.
- **DECISIONS.md** on adoption: (1) crafting expands Minecraft-style with
  proximity-gated stations and one grid UI (furnace excepted); (2) "workbench"
  names the placeable crafting station; docs/06's upgrade shop is renamed;
  (3) wood is the fuel economy (no coal ore exists by choice); (4) fiber
  enters via hash-gated tilling drops; (5) shaped recipes become
  shift-invariant, unmirrored.

## Amendment (2026-08-26, docs/35)

The homestead build mode ([35-homesteads-and-farming.md](35-homesteads-and-farming.md)
§7, the `B` key) is the second consumer of §7's `world_placeable` placement
system: same table, same validation, plus `spaceId`, a data-driven build
palette, and prefab building footprints. Barrels become load-bearing there
(crop barreling) — the §6 barrel recipe is on its critical path.

## 16. Phases 1–3 implementation verification (2026-08-26)

- Shaped recipes normalize to their occupied bounding box, match at every grid
  offset without mirroring, and share one item/recipe registry with commerce,
  labels, icon keys, and recipe-book presentation. The docs/06 §12 goldens
  cover every recipe shipped in this slice.
- `fiber` is awarded by the deterministic 30% tilling hash. The hand tier is
  planks, sticks, torch, campfire, and workbench; all new and previously
  icon-less phase assets are paid-pack, exact-palette extracts recorded as
  assets-as-text. No reference-pack binaries are committed.
- `world_placeable` is additive, space-aware from birth (`spaceId: u16`) and
  indexed by `[spaceId, chunkX, chunkY]`. Workbench, campfire, barrel, fence,
  fence gate, sign, and standing torch place/pick up through the generalized
  hands path. Barrels expose eight authority-owned slots; gates toggle
  collision; fences join by neighbours; campfires and standing torches use the
  shared point-light registry.
- Workbench recipes are validated at an inclusive two-tile boundary by the
  authority before inventory mutation. Placement and crafting statistics are
  recorded only on the successful transaction path. Deterministic two-client
  coverage proves shared workbench gating/removal and shared standing-torch
  light while rejecting cross-space visibility.
- Client recipe-list tests cover station filtering, missing-ingredient state,
  ghost-fill moves, and the locked-result tooltip. The additive module build,
  generated TypeScript bindings, focused authority/client suites, full asset
  validation, and repository `npm run check` are the release gates for this
  entry. Anvil metal gear, gem cutting, and cooking remain untouched.

## 17. Furnace/refinement implementation verification (2026-08-28)

- Loose stones and rock/cellar drops are `pebble`; nine make one `stone`.
  Iron, copper, and gold veins drop matching pieces; nine make an ore chunk.
  Gem nodes retain their direct raw-gem drops and cannot enter a furnace.
- Furnaces craft from an eight-stone ring at a workbench. The authority owns
  input, fuel, and output roles, catches up elapsed bars lazily, and refreshes an
  open furnace on the existing ten-second heartbeat. Output cannot be inserted
  manually. Wood and planks each smelt one bar; sticks do not.
- One bar takes five real minutes. Furnace fire animation and the gold-fill UI
  progress bar derive from `smeltStartTick`; reopening after offline time applies
  all affordable whole-bar completions atomically.
- Furnaces (including their contents) and anvils remain world entities when picked
  up and render over the carrier's head. The barrel now requires six planks and two iron bars and
  uses the licensed closed/open pair while its container is active.
